            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſo ſenſible how great a crime it were to charge a Church of Chriſt with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſtianiſm,</hi> or but che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a ſuſpicion of it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly;</hi> that though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be many other ways a mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our Profeſſion, yet if ſhe had bin clear in this particular, I ſhould much rather have beſtow'd my pains in vindicating, than aſperſing her. For even the beſt of the Reformed Churches has lately bin ſo great a ſufferer under this very ſame unjuſt and execrable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (a Cenſure which is therefore <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable</hi> becauſe <hi>unjuſt;</hi>) that no true Son of hers (I verily believe) would eaſily preſume to load a Chriſtian Church, (though otherwiſe never ſo corrupt)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38410:5"/>with this moſt odious and unchriſtian Calumny. For we have had ſome raſh hot-ſpirited Adverſaries, who have worn the name of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſo thread-bare with their repeated out-cries, and made it ſo ridiculous by their moſt ignorant applications of it; that for a Man to name the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and but give a hint of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or the <hi>Purpled-Whore,</hi> has bin almoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſcandalous, and he could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have eſcap'd the cenſure of a proud, <hi>pedantick</hi> or a factious Perſon.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, ſince (as
<note n="*" place="margin">De Rom. Pont. lib. 3. Cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> informs us) <hi>All the Hereticks</hi> (that is, the famous Proteſtants and Reformers) <hi>of his time,</hi> did jointly teach this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That the Pope is Antichriſt;</hi> why ſhould not <hi>We,</hi> who follow and approve their Judgment in moſt other Points, believe that there is ſomething more than dotage, and the ſpirit of railing, in this their ſo unanimous accuſation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop? If then this Doctrine <hi>(That the Pope is Antichriſt)</hi> be true,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38410:5"/>let it not be diſcountenanc'd but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd: if not, let it for ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and ſilenc'd. As for my own particular, if any thing that I ſhall write againſt the Succeſſor of that great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (as they tell us) ſhall be prov'd er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; I ſhall more willingly retract, than I have written it: and ſhall <hi>beg</hi> his Holineſs's Pardon (though I would not <hi>buy</hi> it) with the moſt devout and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick of his <hi>Romiſh</hi> Proſelytes.</p>
            <p>But above all, I here unſeignedly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what-ever I have ſaid, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judgment of the Sober, Learned, and Religious of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but eſpecially of ſuch Perſons, who have bin a little converſant in this kind of Study, and have a Genius prompting them to theſe Diſcoveries. For elſe I muſt confeſs, that though my Reader ſhould be never ſo judicious in other Points, he is not ſuch a Judge as I could wiſh to have. For he that comes with an averſion to the <hi>Subject, prejudges</hi> the Diſcourſe before he <hi>reades</hi> it. But if any Man propenſe to theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38410:6"/>ſhall happen to peruſe this ſorry Treatiſe: I hope that he will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>find</hi> ſome ſatisfaction here from <hi>mine,</hi> or <hi>give</hi> me better by his Labours.</p>
            <p>Let this then be the Queſtion, which it is the adequate ſcope and drift of theſe enſuing Papers to reſolve, <hi>Whether or no the <hi>Pope</hi> be <hi>Antichriſt?</hi>
               </hi> But ſince the name of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is ambiguous, (to avoid all needleſs cavils about <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names;</hi>) by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> I mean that <hi>Beaſt</hi> deſcribed <hi>Revel.</hi> xvii. called <hi>The Beast that was, and is not,</hi> and ſaid to be <hi>the Eighth</hi> King of that City and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which are repreſented in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and none elſe intended in the preſent Diſputation, of whom we purpoſe to enquire exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> be this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> or not. And in this diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I ſhall uſe the greateſt plainneſs and ſincerity in the World, not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſquoting, ſtraining, or miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting any Type or Paſſage I ſhall meddle with; but carrying through the whole as even an hand as poſſible, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38410:6"/>I may neither do the Truth an injury, nor give any juſt occaſion to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to ſpeak reproachfully of that which I intended for his good, and for the common benefit of the Church of God. For as I think the contrary a diſhoneſt courſe, and utterly miſbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Truth which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, and the Religion I profeſs: So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as needleſs upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as on any other Subject whatſoever. For I am here engag'd upon an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein not only Truth (as I conceive) is <hi>evident,</hi> and therefore needs no Stratagem to defend it; but is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſo <hi>ſad</hi> a Truth, that one would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>fear</hi> than <hi>hope for</hi> Victory in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for it.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Method of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I ſhall begin with the Angel's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Viſion, which we have in <hi>Revel.</hi> xvii; and when I have clear'd the meaning of the Angel's words in that Chapter, I ſhall proceed from thence to the xiith and xiiith Chapters, which have the neareſt correſpondence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38410:7"/>and affinity with the other, and may, as I ſuppoſe, be fully explicated by that light the Angel gives us in the xviith Chapter. For there are ſome things concerning Antichriſt more needful, to be known than others, more clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Holy Scriptures, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the knowledg and unfolding of the reſt does very much depend. I ſhall therefore begin with thoſe things which are moſt perſpicuouſly revealed concerning Antichriſt, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſuch deſcriptions of him as are more myſterious and obſcure. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſuppoſe the Holy Ghoſt has made ſome things ſo clear and evident, that by the light of theſe we might the better penetrate into thoſe that are more dark and myſtical. Since then the Angel in my judgment has moſt manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us the Myſtery of that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Woman</hi> that was ſeen to ſit upon him, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. I ſhall begin with theſe; and if I can but give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſatisfaction as to theſe particulars. I doubt not by the help of theſe to make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38410:7"/>an eaſie paſſage through the reſt, though in themſelves more difficult and almoſt inexplicable.</p>
            <p>In order then to the unfolding of this Queſtion concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I ſhall premiſe this general Maxim; <hi>That he to whom all Signs and Tokens, Characters and deſcriptions, of that Antichriſt we are now enquiring after, according as the Scripture lays them down, are nationally and truly applicable, without any, manner of abſurdity in Reaſon, or inconſiſtence with the Analogy of Scripture, is that very Antichriſt we are ſeeking for.</hi> This I thought good to admoniſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of afore-hand, becauſe there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Texts of Scripture, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Prophetical part of it, which may (for ought I know) admit of divers good and ſound interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and there may be ſome marks of Antichriſt, that <hi>ſingly</hi> are as applicable to other Perſons not at all intended or deſigned in the holy Scripture. But this is certain, that he or they to whom, not only <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the ſigns
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38410:8"/>and marks of Antichriſt are rationally and truly applicable, muſt needs be Antichriſt; and therefore if they be thus applicable to the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> For certainly it cannot be, that the holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſhould have deſcribed <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by ſuch dubious and uncertain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as may <hi>every one</hi> be rationally accommodated to the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>undefiled Spouſe</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That therefore we may put this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to a ſpeedy iſſue, I ſhall obſerve but one thing more, whereof it may be requiſit to forewarn ſome Readers, leſt otherwiſe they ſhould be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>abſtruſeneſs</hi> and <hi>myſteriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Prophetick ſtyle, eſpecially of thoſe Prophecies we have now to deal with. For Prophecy affects a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſort of Language from the vulgar Phraſe, and loves to cloath it ſelf in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories</hi> and obſcure expreſſions, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, like the Author of it, in a Cloud: there being many Chapters of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> which ſeem to be but one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38410:8"/>Metaphor, and hardly any ſingle Verſe without its Figure. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall meet with Cities called <hi>Women;</hi> People, <hi>Waters;</hi> Idol-worſhip, <hi>Whoredom;</hi> Kings and Kingdoms typed out by <hi>Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> of Beaſts. Which Types are not devices to obſcure the Prophecy, or to help it out by giving ſcope to greater latitude of Interpretation, (for they are capable of a certain ſence, as will be ſeen hereafter:) but they ſerve to render it the more illuſtrious, by hiding it from common view, and ſo ſecuring it from profane approaches; quickning the pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Faithful in the diſcovery of it, and procuring great eſteem and veneration to it. Nor is there any cauſe to wonder that the Spirit of Prophecy ſhould appropriate to himſelf a form of ſpeech and manner of expreſſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from the vulgar: ſince there is hardly any Art or Science but affects the ſame. Which though it look like <hi>Canting</hi> to the Ignorant; yet to thoſe that are experienced in the Study, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38410:9"/>terms are known to be moſt proper and ſignificant. It is not therefore any ſtrangerthing to meet with <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Horns,</hi> and <hi>Whores,</hi> and ſuch like terms and types, and figurative expreſſions in Prophetick Writings, than to read of <hi>Nouns</hi> and <hi>Verbs</hi> in Grammar: of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,</hi> and <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Notions</hi> in Logick: or of <hi>Rhombs, Rhomboides, Parallelograms,</hi> and ſuch like odd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sciences.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I will not go about to prove that the Father ſpeaks here of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Antichriſt, for I never heard of any that denied it. Only we may obſerve, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking in the name of the Whole Church of Chriſt, delivers it as the ſenſe of all Chriſtians in general, and that not doubtfully, but peremtorily, that this greateſt of Perſecutions was to come upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Roman Empire, <hi>Scimus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vim maximam vniverſo orbi imminentem, ipſamque clauſulam ſaeculi acerbibates horrendas comminantem, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani Imperii commeatu retardari;</hi> that is, <hi>We know theſe miſeries are retarded by the interpoſition of the Roman Empire.</hi> It was therefore, it ſeems, a thing not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38410:11"/>in thoſe primitive times, but that Antichriſt ſhould raiſe himſelf upon the ruins of the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>And this was look't upon to have bin the tradition of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> For wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.) and ſpeaking there concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Antichriſt, and what it was that obſtructed his coming at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, he has theſe words, at verſ. 5. and 6. <hi>Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you theſe things? And now ye know what with-holdeth, that he might be revealed in his time.</hi> From whence it appears, that the Apoſtle had told theſe <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> by word of mouth, what it was that impeded the coming of Antichriſt, and upon the removal whereof Antichriſt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be revealed. (For that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of Antichriſt, <hi>de noviſſimo illo Antichriſto,</hi> of that laſt Antichriſt, the forerunner of the day of Judgment; <hi>nulli dubium eſt,</hi> (as
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Civit. Dei. Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us) i. e. <hi>no
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38410:11"/>man doubts.</hi>) But the thing which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, being the preſent Power of the Roman Empire, the Apoſtle does not openly declare in Writing what it was,
<note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> leſt he might ſeem a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſaffected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it was hoped by the Romans that their Empire ſhould endure for ever. Hence that complaint of <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in the place aforequoted, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcanting upon thoſe words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>And now ye know what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, that he might be revealed in his time;</hi> does thus lament the obſcurity of this Myſtery: <hi>and therefore we</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>who know not what they knew, deſire to attain with labour the Apoſtles meaning, yet we are not able.</hi> So that this point ſo well known to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> in the Apoſtles time, and for about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, namely to thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the age <hi>Tertullian</hi> liv'd in, was come, it ſeems, (ſuch is the nature of unwritten Tradition) to be accounted difficult if not unexplicable, by <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's</hi> days.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38410:12"/>
               <p>And indeed this was no more than what might well have bin expected, that ſeeing Antichriſt was to come, and to prevail ſo mightily even in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the living God, the nearer we approach his time, the more obſcure ſhould be the marks and tokens of his coming; leſt being known, he ſhould have miſt of that reception which he was to meet with. Yet notwithſtanding, this Notion of his coming we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, had ſo much credit in <hi>St. Auſtin's</hi> time, that he himſelf eſteem'd it no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, to interpret, <hi>that which hindred,</hi> of the Roman Empire. His words are theſe
<note n="*" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Illud tamen quod ait Apoſtolus, Tantum qui modò te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, teneat,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>But that which the Apoſtle ſaith, Only he which now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, let him withhold, until he be taken out of the way, is not abſurdly believ'd to have bin ſpoken of the Roman Empire it ſelf, as if it were ſaid, Only he that now reigneth, let him reign, until he be taken out of the way,</hi> i. e. <hi>until he be deſtroyed: And then ſhall that Wicked be revealed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38410:12"/>by whom that Antichriſt is intended, no Man doubts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since therefore this Tradition, though at firſt not doubted, has not with equal certainty bin delivered in ſucceeding Ages: We ſhall further ſhew, that this Tradition is not meerly oral, but has a moſt unqueſtionable foundation in the Holy Scriptures. For what <hi>St. Paul</hi> did not think fit to ſpeak of openly in his Epiſtle, was afterwards declared to <hi>St. John</hi> in Viſion, and is by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the Church in writing, in the xvii Chapter of his Revelation.</p>
               <p>Now, Reader, that thou mayeſt be able clearly to diſcern, and certainly comprehend the proof that we ſhall bring from hence, (for I deſire thee to take notice that the main hinge of our Diſpute concerning Antichriſt does chiefly turn upon this very Chapter) I ſhall therefore ſet it down <hi>verbatim</hi> as it lies, dividing it (as it divides it ſelf) into two general parts, the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>And there came one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Angels, which had the ſeven Vials, and talked with me, ſaying unto me, Come hither, I will ſhew unto thee the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great Whore, that ſitteth upon many Waters.</hi>

The plain meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, That the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> are <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> ſucceſſively coming up upon the <hi>Beaſt, five</hi> whereof were come and gone at the time when the Angel interpreted this <hi>Viſion</hi> to St. <hi>John, one</hi> was then in being at that very time, and <hi>the other</hi> was not then come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction's ſake, when we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of any thing done by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38410:15"/>the <hi>Beast</hi> in the time of his <hi>first Head,</hi> we ſhall call him the <hi>Beaſt under the firſt Head;</hi> if of any thing done by him in the time of his <hi>ſecond Head,</hi> we ſhall call him <hi>the Beaſt under the ſecond Head;</hi> if of any thing done by him in the time of his <hi>third, fourth, fifth, ſixth,</hi> or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head,</hi> we call him reſpectively the <hi>Beast under the third, fourth, fifth, ſixth,</hi> or <hi>ſeventh Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt obſerve that St. <hi>John</hi> in the Viſion ſaw but <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> which the Angel expounds to be <hi>ſeven Kings.</hi> But when he comes to reckon up theſe <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> he enumerates <hi>eight. Five</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are fallen; one is, and the other is not yet come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth King, and is of the ſeven.</hi> So that there muſt be one of theſe eight Kings that is not typiſied by any Head. For there are but <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> and thoſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> the Angel tells us are <hi>ſeven Kings.</hi> If they had bin <hi>eight Kings,</hi> the Angel would have told us ſo. But when he tells us, <hi>the ſeven Heads are ſeven Kings,</hi> he means, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38410:15"/>are <hi>but ſeven,</hi> and no more. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he reckons up <hi>eight Kings,</hi> to let us know that there is one of them; that is not of the ſame nature with the reſt; and therefore is not typified by any <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For otherwiſe how eaſie had it bin, either for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to have ſaid, The <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> are <hi>eight Kings;</hi> or rather for the Spirit to have repreſented the <hi>Beast</hi> with the <hi>eight Heads,</hi> if there had bin <hi>eight Kings</hi> to be typified by the <hi>Heads?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither will it ſuffice to ſay, That the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of theſe <hi>eight Kings</hi> was to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> but a <hi>ſhort ſpace,</hi> and therefore may be included in one of the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> together with another <hi>King.</hi> For there are no <hi>eight Kings</hi> whom we can with any reaſon imagin to be here meant, but the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of them will appear to be of as long continuance as ſome one or other that is typified by a <hi>Head.</hi> Wherefore it muſt needs be granted, that one of theſe <hi>eight Kings</hi> is not typified by any <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And which is he? Not any of the ſix firſt <hi>Kings;</hi> for there is no doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38410:16"/>cerning any one of them, but that they are all of the number of the <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> that are typified by the <hi>ſeven Heads.</hi> But concerning the ſeventh and eighth <hi>Kings,</hi> the Angel ſeems to anſwer a doubt that might ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Which of them is of the number of the ſeven <hi>Kings,</hi> that are typified by the ſeven <hi>Heads?</hi> And he tells us plainly, That <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not, he is the eighth</hi> King, <hi>and is of the ſeven.</hi> Which is, as if he had ſaid, The <hi>ſeventh</hi> King is none of the <hi>ſeven</hi> Kings which are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> but <hi>the eighth</hi> King is one of that number. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſixth <hi>Head</hi> and the ſeventh there was a <hi>King</hi> to come, that ſhould be of a quite different nature from the other Kings: during whoſe Reign, the <hi>Beast,</hi> which is deſcribed at verſ. 3. as being <hi>full of names of Blaſphemy,</hi> ſhould want an <hi>Head,</hi> but afterwards he ſhould revive, and get another <hi>Head,</hi> who ſhould be the eighth <hi>King,</hi> and of the number of the ſeven, which are typified by the Heads of the blaſphemous Beaſt</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:38410:16"/>3. We muſt obſerve that although the <hi>Woman</hi> was ſeen ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with ſeven Heads, yet in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation ſhe is conſidered only as ſitting upon the <hi>Beast</hi> under his ſeventh or laſt Head. This is evident from ver. 11. in theſe words, <hi>And the Beaſt that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the ſeven;</hi> that is, he is the eighth <hi>King</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>King</hi> that is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by no <hi>Head,</hi> and he is one of the <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> that are typified by the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads.</hi> For that this <hi>Beaſt which was, and is not,</hi> is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which was repreſented to St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Viſion,</hi> appears from ver. 8. where the Angel beginning to interpret the <hi>Viſion</hi> to St. <hi>John,</hi> tells him, That <hi>the Beaſt which he ſaw, was, and is not, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>Beaſt</hi> therefore, <hi>which was, and is not,</hi> being the <hi>Beaſt</hi> upon which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting: ſince this Beaſt is interpreted to be, not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in general under all his <hi>Heads,</hi> nor under the <hi>firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth,</hi> or <hi>ſixth,</hi> but only under his <hi>ſeventh</hi> or <hi>laſt Head;</hi> it is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38410:17"/>manifeſt that the <hi>Woman</hi> is conſiderable in this Prophecy, only as ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> under his <hi>ſeventh</hi> or <hi>laſt Head,</hi> and alſo that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelf is here conſidered under no other <hi>Head</hi> but that.</p>
               <p>And this appears yet further from the particular enumeration of the ſeveral <hi>Heads,</hi> as the Angel mentions them in the Interpretation of the <hi>Viſion.</hi> For is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> conſider'd under his firſt <hi>five Heads?</hi> No; theſe are <hi>fallen,</hi> ſays the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; and ſo, paſt and gone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of this conſideration. Is then the Beaſt conſider'd here under this ſixth Head? No neither; for there is no more ſaid of this <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> but only that <hi>he is.</hi> It remains therefore that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould be conſider'd here only under his <hi>laſt Head</hi> of all. And indeed of this only it is ſaid at ver. 8. <hi>The Beaſt which thou ſaweſt, was, and is not, &amp;c.</hi> For at ver. 11. <hi>The Beaſt which was, and is not,</hi> is interpreted only of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> or <hi>laſt Head</hi> of all. Nor is there any thing foretold in all this 17th Chapter, of any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38410:17"/>other Head but this. So that, whereas the <hi>Woman</hi> is repreſented <hi>ſitting upon a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, full of names of Blaſphemy, arrayed in Scarlet, with a Golden Cup in her hand, and on her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head this Inſcription,</hi> MYSTERY, BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYLON THE GREAT, &amp;c. And <hi>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi> It is as evident as any thing can be, that by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is to be underſtood the <hi>Beaſt</hi> under his <hi>laſt Head</hi> only; and that the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the time of his laſt <hi>Head,</hi> ſhould be thus accoutred and arrayed, inſcrib'd and drunken.</p>
               <p>Hence then we may underſtand the meaning of the Angel, when at ver. 8. he tells St. <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>the Beast which he ſaw, was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit.</hi> And again, at the end of the ſame verſe; that <hi>the Beast was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> For hereby is ſignified that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw, was the ſame <hi>Beaſt</hi> which had bin under the firſt <hi>five Heads,</hi> that were then
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38410:18"/>
                  <hi>fallen;</hi> yea, and the ſame that was then in being under the ſixth <hi>Head,</hi> but that he was not as then come under his <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> or laſt <hi>Head,</hi> in which only he was conſiderable in the <hi>Viſion.</hi> Which Expoſition as it is eaſie and obvious in it ſelf, conſidering how the Angel has interpreted the ſeven Heads or Kings: So the Angel himſelf may ſeem on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to direct us to it, in that ſo ſoon as he had ſpoken ſo myſteriouſly of the Beaſt, telling us, <hi>that he was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> he preſently ſubjoins, <hi>Here is the Mind that hath Wiſdom.</hi> Which is as if he had ſaid, You ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what is meant by this myſterious deſcription of the Beaſt, by comparing it with the following Interpretation For the Beaſt <hi>was</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus cleared what might ſeet difficult in the Angel's Interpretation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Viſion,</hi> let us proceed to the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38410:18"/>of it. And let us enquire, who this <hi>Woman</hi> is that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw <hi>ſitting upon the Beaſt</hi> under his <hi>ſeventh</hi> or laſt <hi>Head?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Woman is certainly to be known by two ſorts of marks, (though the firſt ſort alone I take to be abundantly ſufficient to diſtinguiſh her from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women in the World, and ſhall partly ground my ſelf upon that Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the diſcovering of the other.) Of the firſt ſort are ſuch Marks as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to her ſelf. Of the other ſort are ſuch as belong to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhe ſitteth on. The Marks belonging to the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> her ſelf, are deſcribed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel at ver. 9, 18.</p>
               <p>At ver. 18. ſhe is deſcribed in theſe words; <hi>The Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> Here the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is interpreted to be <hi>that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> So that the <hi>Woman</hi> plainly ſignifies that <hi>Great</hi> Imperial <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> her <hi>ſitting</hi> on the Beaſt denoting her <hi>Imperial Soveraignty.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:38410:19"/>
               <p>Now though it be ſaid, The <hi>Woman</hi> is that great City, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> which <hi>now reigneth over the Kings of the Earth</hi> (it being ſpoken in the Preſent tenſe:) Yet ſome may cavil, and object, That it is not needful to underſtand it of any City then in being, but of ſome other that ſhould afterwards ariſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Propheſies it is a common thing to uſe <hi>the preſent</hi> for <hi>the future</hi> Tenſe, and ſpeak of things as <hi>being,</hi> which are yet <hi>to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this will appear to be a mere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, when we ſhall have conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That one of the <hi>Kings</hi> of this <hi>great City,</hi> was then reigning, being the ſixth of thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> ſhe had enjoied. So that this <hi>great City,</hi> of whom it is ſaid that <hi>ſhe reigneth over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> muſt needs have bin a <hi>City</hi> then in <hi>being,</hi> and then <hi>reigning</hi> alſo under that King who had the Sovereignty at that time over her.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That theſe words are not to be look'd upon as a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of a Prophecy. It were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38410:19"/>very abſurd to apply thoſe rules of ſpeaking to <hi>Interpretations,</hi> which are obſerved to be uſed in Prophecies. For therefore the <hi>Interpretations</hi> ſhould be plain, becauſe the Prophecies are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That although (as we ſaid) the <hi>Beaſt</hi> be here conſidered as to his laſt <hi>Head</hi> only; yet St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the ſame <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting upon him under all his ſeven <hi>Heads.</hi> So that ſhe which ſate upon him under his <hi>ſeventh</hi> or laſt <hi>Head,</hi> was ſeen to ſit upon him under the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and all the reſt of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If we conſider how preciſely the Angel all along in this <hi>Interpretation</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the punctual differences of the Times <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come;</hi> we cannot think without the greateſt folly and abſurdity, that he confounds them only in this 18th verſe. For at ver. 8. he tells St. <hi>John</hi> concerning the Beaſt, that <hi>he was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> expreſly noting the differences of the times. And ſo again at the end of the ſame verſe, he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38410:20"/>calls him the <hi>Beaſt which was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> The like we find a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the <hi>ſeven Kings. Five</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come, &amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe it is ſpoken of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> that they <hi>are ten Kings which have received no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast.</hi> And thus we ſhall find that the Angel is exceeding punctual all along, that no Man might with any ſhew of Reaſon miſinterpret or miſunderſtand him. Wherefore we cannot doubt, but that he uſeth the ſame plainneſs at ver. 18. where he tells St. <hi>John, The Woman which thou ſawest is that great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> and that he meant it of that <hi>great</hi> Imperial <hi>City</hi> which then reigned at that preſent time.</p>
               <p>If it be further urged, That even in this <hi>Interpretation</hi> we are ſpeaking of the Angel has no leſs than four times uſed the <hi>preſent tenſe</hi> for the <hi>future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, True; But then we muſt obſerve withal, that he has never uſed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38410:20"/>one of theſe <hi>Tenſes</hi> for the other, but when he has as good as told us in the Context, that he does ſo: So that he leaves no doubt or ſcruple in what <hi>Tenſe</hi> he means it. As for example; when at verſ. 11. it is ſaid, <hi>The Beaſt which was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is of the ſeven, and goeth into Perdition.</hi> Here the word <hi>goeth,</hi> is uſed for <hi>ſhall go;</hi> but without any Ambiguity at all; for he had plainly told us juſt before, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> he ſpeaks of was to come. Since therefore it is manifeſt to every Man, that the Beaſt could not <hi>go into perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before he came, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his <hi>going</hi> into perdition, but in the future Tenſe. So that although the Angel ſaies <hi>he goeth,</hi> yet 'tis as certain that he meaneth <hi>ſhall go,</hi> as if he had expreſt it in that very form.</p>
               <p>The ſame Anſwer, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> will ſerve for the other three places in this Interpretation, where the Angel uſes the <hi>preſent</hi> for the <hi>future</hi> Tenſe. As at ver. 12. Where <hi>receive</hi> is put for <hi>ſhall receive;</hi> at ver. 13. where <hi>Theſe have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38410:21"/>one Mind,</hi> is put for <hi>Theſe ſhall have one mind.</hi> And laſtly, at ver. 17. where it is ſaid, <hi>That God hath put into their hearts,</hi> inſtead of <hi>God ſhall put into their hearts.</hi> In all which places, although the <hi>preſent</hi> or the <hi>preter</hi> tenſe be uſed for the <hi>future;</hi> yet is the ſence as perfect and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, as if the <hi>future</hi> were expreſt. So that indeed in ſuch a caſe, where it is not poſſible to miſtake the Tenſe, the <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>future</hi> are not to be look'd on as two different Tenſes, but the very ſame.</p>
               <p>But now at ver. 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Woman which thou ſaweſt, it is that great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth:</hi> There is not only no ſuch certainty from the Context, that <hi>reigneth</hi> cannot be underſtood, as it is ſpoken, in the <hi>preſent</hi> tenſe; but rather, as has bin already ſhewed, there is all reaſon from the Context, to evince the contrary. I conclude therefore, that when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel tells St. <hi>John, The Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> he means it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38410:21"/>of that <hi>great</hi> Imperial <hi>City,</hi> which then <hi>reigned,</hi> when this <hi>Viſion</hi> was interpreted.</p>
               <p>And now, What <hi>City</hi> could this be but <hi>Rome?</hi> For, what City was there then in all the World, ſo comparable with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> (much leſs ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding her in Greatneſs and extent of Empire) as to be called by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, <hi>The Lady of the World,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That great City, that reigneth over the Kings of the Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this will further yet appear from certain other Deſcriptions of this Great Imperial City, which the Angel gives us at ver. 9, 10. where we have the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or interpretation of the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw upon the Beaſt. Theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> have a twofold ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification: they ſignify <hi>ſeven Mountains</hi> and <hi>ſeven Kings.</hi> At ver. 9. they are interpreted to be <hi>ſeven Mountains; The ſeven Heads</hi> (ſaith the Angel there) <hi>are ſeven Mountains upon which the Woman ſitteth;</hi> that is, upon which the <hi>great</hi> Imperial <hi>City</hi> is ſituated. Here again we have the Verb <hi>ſitteth</hi> in the Preſent
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38410:22"/>Tenſe, and the meaning muſt be this; That the <hi>Woman</hi> did then ſit upon theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or <hi>Mountains,</hi> when ſhe was repreſented in this Viſion to St. <hi>John.</hi> And to contend for any other City, (as deſign'd by this <hi>Viſion</hi>) which ſhould afterwards ariſe, cannot proceed from any thing but ignorance or prejudice; nor produce any better effects in the explication of this Prophecy than non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and confuſion, and abſurdity. Eſpecially ſince there was then a City, the moſt famous in the World, that was known as well by the name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Septicollis,</hi> that <hi>great</hi> Imperial <hi>City,</hi> ſituate on <hi>ſeven Hills</hi> or <hi>Mountains,</hi> as by any other name. And to this the Poet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes in this Diſtick.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> therefore is undoubtedly the City, which is thus deſcribed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, to be <hi>That great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> and is ſituate on <hi>ſeven Hills</hi> or <hi>Mountains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have further evidence of this matter yet, from that other interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is given us of the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> to wit, that <hi>they are ſeven Kings.</hi> But before I proceed to the Application of this part of the Angels interpretation, it may be needful to enquire, in what place theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> are to be ſought for. This place the Angel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates to us at ver. 18. <hi>The Woman which thou ſaweſt, is that great City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> For, for what other reaſon can this City here be call'd the <hi>Reigning,</hi> Soveraign, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial <hi>City,</hi> but becauſe ſhe was <hi>Imperii locus</hi> (as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſtiles her) the <hi>proper Seat</hi> or Reſidence <hi>of her Kings?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:38410:23"/>
               <p>And this the Angel yet more plainly explicates. ver. 9, where he tells us, that the <hi>ſeven Heads are ſeven Mountains, on which the Woman ſitteth,</hi> or, on which that great City is ſeated. For hence it is evident, that theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> are to be ſought for not in any other place or places of the Empire, but only in this great <hi>ſeven-hill'd City.</hi> For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw but <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> in all, and theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> the Angel tells us were within the City. Whatever therefore is the meaning or interpretation of them, it muſt there be ſought for.</p>
               <p>As therefore theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>ſeven Mountains</hi> within the City, ſo they muſt ſignify <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> within the ſame. For where the Heads were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there alſo muſt be ſought whatever is deſigned by them. Since therefore theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> as they are put to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Mountains,</hi> are placed by the Angel in the City, there alſo we muſt place them as they ſignifie the <hi>Kings.</hi> And thus we have another Character of this <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> which we may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38410:23"/>thus expreſs together with the reſt: That ſhe was that <hi>great City</hi> which in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time reigned <hi>over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> was ſituate <hi>upon ſeven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and was to be the Royal Seat, or Reſidence of <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> ſucceeding one another in her.</p>
               <p>But poſſibly ſome may here imagin, That in this Notion concerning the placing of the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> I am very far departed from the exactneſs of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> which I have all along pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obſerve. For whereas St. <hi>John ſaw a Woman ſitting on a Beaſt, having ſeven Heads,</hi> (whereby is ſignified that the ſeven Heads belonged to the Beaſt) I contrariwiſe have placed them in the <hi>Woman.</hi> But the Anſwer is obvious; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not I that place them in the <hi>Woman,</hi> but the Angel in effect that does it. For ſo he tells us at ver. 9. <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads are ſeven Mountains, on which the Woman ſitteth.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>ſeven</hi> Mountains are placed by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in the City, it follows of neceſſity,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38410:24"/>that the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> which ſignifie the <hi>ſeven Mountains</hi> muſt belong alſo to the <hi>Woman</hi> in the Viſion. And on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide again, becauſe the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> it follows by the like neceſſity of Reaſon that the <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> alſo, which are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the <hi>City</hi> in the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>This I ſpeak upon ſuppoſition, that the Angel has not interpreted the ſeven Heads to belong unto the City, as they ſignifie <hi>ſeven Mountains;</hi> and not to belong unto the <hi>City,</hi> or to belong but partly unto the <hi>City,</hi> and partly to ſome other place, as they ſignifie <hi>ſeven Kings.</hi> For ſince the Angel has placed the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> (as they ſignifie <hi>ſeven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>) within the <hi>City;</hi> and has not diſplaced them, nor any of them as they ſignifie ſeven Kings: we are obliged to follow the Authority of the Angel, and it were a moſt intolerable preſumption in a worſe Interpreter to diſplace them. But,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:38410:24"/>2. In making the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long intirely to the <hi>Woman,</hi> we do not in the leaſt diſpoil the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of them. For ſince the <hi>Woman</hi> is interpreted the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> as the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> is a part or portion of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Woman</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Whatever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appertaineth to the <hi>Woman,</hi> muſt of neceſſity appertain as well unto the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we conſider that the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial City</hi> is the moſt conſiderable part of any Kingdom for the bigneſs of it; where can we better place the <hi>Heads</hi> belonging to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> or Kingdom than in the nobleſt and moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part about him?</p>
               <p>And now it is time that we proceed to ſhew who are meant by theſe <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> ſucceſſively coming up upon the <hi>Beast</hi> within this <hi>great City.</hi> In order whereunto we muſt obſerve; That this word <hi>King</hi> is otherwiſe taken in the Interpretations of Prophetick <hi>Viſions,</hi> than it is wont to be in other Writings. For whereas in other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38410:25"/>it uſually ſignifies but one <hi>ſingle King:</hi> it is uſed in the Interpretations of Prophetick <hi>Viſions,</hi> for a <hi>Kingdom</hi> with the whole Order or Succeſſion of its Kings.</p>
               <p>Neither is this any critical or caſual Obſervation, but the conſtant courſe and method of the Scriptures in our preſent caſe, as we may ſee in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32. Where King <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> is ſaid to have repreſented unto him in a Dream <hi>a great Image, whoſe Head was of pure Gold; his Breaſt and his Arms, of Silver; his Belly and his Thighs of Braſs; his Legs of Iron; his Feet, part of Iron and part Clay.</hi> For the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Viſion</hi> to King <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> thus addreſſes himſelf to him, at ver. 37. <hi>Thou, O King, art a King of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou art this head of Gold.</hi> Now although the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeems thus particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to interpret this <hi>Golden Head</hi> of King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Perſon, ſaying, <hi>Thou art this Head of Gold:</hi> Yet indeed he does not mean it of his <hi>Perſon</hi> only, but alſo of his Kingdom, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38410:25"/>And this appears to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's meaning from what he adds at ver. 39. <hi>After thee ſhall ariſe another Kingdom inferiour to thee, and another third Kingdom of Braſs,</hi> &amp;c. where by comparing of King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> with other Kingdoms, it is plain that he ſpeaks not of the King's <hi>perſon</hi> only, but of his <hi>Kingdom</hi> too. And becauſe the Prophet tells him, That <hi>after him ſhould ariſe another Kingdom inferiour to him,</hi> it is likewiſe evident that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his Succeſſors alſo. For that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom did not ariſe after King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> but by the interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Son <hi>Evil-merodach,</hi> and his Grandſon <hi>Balthaſſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus again, <hi>Dan.</hi> ii. 44. the Prophet uſeth the names of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> promiſcuouſly. His words be theſe, And <hi>in the days of thoſe Kings,</hi> (viz. of the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> afore ſpoken of) <hi>ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom, which ſhall never be destroyed, and the Kingdom ſhall not be left to other People, but it ſhall break in peices, and conſume all theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38410:26"/>(which at the begining of this verſe are called <hi>Kings) and it ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we may obſerve <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Theſe great Beaſts which are four, are four Kings,</hi> &amp;c. Now although in this <hi>ver.</hi> 17. theſe <hi>four Beaſts</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>four Kings;</hi> yet at <hi>ver.</hi> 23. the <hi>fourth</hi> of them is ſaid to be the <hi>fourth Kingdom.</hi> And as it is ſaid in the deſcription of this <hi>Viſion</hi> at verſ. 7. that the <hi>fourth Beast ſhould be divers from all the Beaſts that were before it.</hi> So here, at ver. 23. it is ſaid by way of Interpretation, that <hi>the fourth Kingdom ſhall be diverſe from all Kingdoms;</hi> that is, from all <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> that were before it. As therefore at ver. 17. the <hi>four Beaſts</hi> are interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>four Kings:</hi> So we ſee that at ver. 23. they are expounded <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> And ſeeing that theſe <hi>four Kings</hi> were to reign from <hi>Daniel's time until the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſit, and the Kingdom ſhould be given to the Saints of the Moſt High;</hi> that is, as all Interpreters confeſs, almoſt until the firſt coming of Chriſt; and, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38410:26"/>the moſt and beſt of them expound it, (amongſt whom even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is one) until the ſecond coming of Chriſt to Judgment; it is manifeſt that by theſe <hi>four Kings</hi> or <hi>Kingdoms</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant any <hi>four ſingle Kings</hi> reigning in their ſeveral Kingdoms, but <hi>four ſeveral Kingdoms</hi> with the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſucceſſion of their <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things may be ſufficient for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as are not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Argument: and for ſuch as are, they know ſo well the truth of what I here aſſert, that they will think I have inlarg'd too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe there is one place even in the interpretation of a prophetick <hi>Viſion</hi> wherein this word <hi>King</hi> is uſed to ſignifie a <hi>ſingle King</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from others of the ſame Kingdom: though I have ſaid ſo much already, yet I muſt crave the Reader's patience to conſider it a little further, that I may make the Argument as clear, and leave as little prejudice as I can againſt it.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38410:27"/>It is truth therefore that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.21. a <hi>King</hi> is ſet to ſignifie a <hi>ſingle King.</hi> The words are theſe, <hi>The rough Goat is the King of Graecia; and the great Horn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Eyes is the firſt King.</hi> Obſerve here that by the <hi>King of Graecia,</hi> in the firſt clauſe of this verſe, is meant the whole Kingdom of <hi>Graecia</hi> under all its Kings.

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:38410:27"/>But here the Context leads us to the meaning of it. For he is typified by <hi>a little Horn,</hi> as you may ſee it, at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. which <hi>little Horn,</hi> is there ſaid to come out of one of thoſe <hi>four notable Horns</hi> which aroſe up in the ſtead of the firſt <hi>great Horn.</hi> Since therefore (as hath bin ſhewed) by the firſt <hi>great Horn</hi> is meant but one <hi>ſingle King:</hi> how can we think that by that <hi>King,</hi> who in the ſame <hi>Viſion</hi> is typified but by a <hi>little Horn,</hi> ſhould be meant any more Kings than one? And therefore it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this one <hi>Viſion,</hi> that, leſt we ſhould miſtake the other <hi>four notable Horns</hi> for <hi>four ſingle Kings</hi> alſo, they are interpreted at <hi>ver.</hi> 22. not <hi>four Kings</hi> (as is uſual in other <hi>Viſions</hi>) but <hi>four Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is one thing more to be obſerv'd in this caſe that we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, concerning the uſe of that type of an <hi>Horn,</hi> to ſignifie a <hi>ſingle King.</hi> For when a Beaſt is repreſented with two, four, ten, or more Horns, they alwaies ſignifie that Beaſt or Kingnom to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38410:28"/>into a like number of Kingdoms, <hi>viz.</hi> as many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> as the Beaſt had <hi>Horns.</hi> But now when a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is ſeen to have but one <hi>Horn</hi> (as in the caſe of the great and little Horns we were ſpeaking of but now) this <hi>one Horn</hi> cannot ſignify the diviſion of a Kingdom into one Kingdom, (for that were nonſence;) and therefore when this <hi>ſingle Horn</hi> coming out of a <hi>Beast,</hi> or out of another <hi>Horn</hi> (or Kingdom) is interpreted a <hi>King;</hi> ſince it cannot ſignify a Kingdom into which that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or other Horn, ſhould be divided, it muſt needs ſignifie one <hi>ſingle King</hi> apart from others of his dignity in that <hi>Beaſt</hi> or Kingdom. So that although in this Chapter the word <hi>King</hi> be twice uſed to ſignifie but one <hi>ſingle King:</hi> Yet this will not hinder but that in all other places it ſhould ſignifie a whole Order or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Kings, where there is not the like ſpecial Reaſon from the Context, or from the ſingularity of the <hi>Horn,</hi> to expound it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But now in <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii, in the Angel's
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38410:28"/>Interpretation of that <hi>Viſion</hi> there, there is not only no ſuch Reaſon as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. to expound the <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, to be <hi>ſeven ſingle Kings</hi> apart from others of the ſame Order, but there is great reaſon from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and from the plurality of Kings, to evince the contrary. For we ſee there are <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> ſpoken of, and not one <hi>ſingle King;</hi> and whereas there is mention made but of <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> in one verſe, and of <hi>ten</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it is confeſſed generally, and even by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, that by the ten Kings are meant not ten <hi>ſingle Kings,</hi> but <hi>ten</hi> ſeveral <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> with the whole Order or Succeſſion of their Kings.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo clear even from the very Circumſtances of the Text it ſelf. For of theſe ten Kings it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 12. That <hi>they are ten Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> Seeing therefore that theſe ten Kings receive their Kingdoms not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38410:29"/>but altogether with the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> we cannot underſtand them of <hi>ten ſingle Kings.</hi> We cannot think therefore but that when the Angel, (that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Interpreter of the Viſion) ſpeaks of <hi>ſeven</hi> other <hi>Kings</hi> in the ſame breath (as it were) without any intimation of a difference in the acceptation of the word, he means the ſame thing by Kings in one, as in the other place; and that he would not have us underſtand <hi>ſeven ſingle Kings,</hi> but <hi>ſeven</hi> ſeveral <hi>ſeries</hi> of <hi>ſeven</hi> ſeveral <hi>Kings,</hi> including all that had and ſhould ſucceed them in their ſeveral Times and Orders.</p>
               <p>And thus we have one Argument from the uſe of this word <hi>King</hi> in the Interpretations of Prophetick <hi>Viſions,</hi> that by theſe <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> cannot be meant <hi>ſeven ſingle Kings,</hi> but <hi>ſeven</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Orders,</hi> Series, Catalogues, or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of them.</p>
               <p>But yet we have another Argument, which is likewiſe taken from the Text it ſelf, and may well ſerve both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the former, and explain it. And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38410:29"/>this is drawn from the uſe of the word <hi>[Beast]</hi> in Prophetick Viſions: which being always interpreted a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> is never ſet to ſignifie a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle King apart from others of the ſame Order in his Kingdom. Not but that a <hi>Beast</hi> may be uſed to typifie a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with one <hi>ſingle King,</hi> if it has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had more Kings than one; which is a very rare unuſual caſe: but that when any <hi>ſingle King</hi> is meant to be deſigned from amongſt his fellow-Kings, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has bin typified by a <hi>Beast,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>a ſingle Horn</hi> coming out of a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or out of another <hi>Horn.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when there was occaſion in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. to typifie two <hi>ſingle Kings</hi> (as hath bin ſaid) they are not repreſented by <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> but by two <hi>ſingle Horns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſhall make it manifeſt, that in the interpretation of this Viſion of the <hi>Beaſt having ſeven Heads,</hi> we are to conſider every <hi>Head</hi> together with the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and to interpret them as if they had bin ſeen <hi>ſeven</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Beaſts</hi> or Kingdoms.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:38410:30"/>
               <p>And for this Method of interpreting we have the moſt unqueſtionable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Angel himſelf. For as for the laſt of <hi>the ſeven Heads</hi> he plainly calls it <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and interprets it as ſuch at <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>The Beaſt</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>which was, and is not, even he is the eighth King, and is of the ſeven, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he is the laſt of the <hi>ſeven Kings.</hi> Nothing therefore can be more evident, than that the laſt of <hi>the ſeven Kings</hi> is to be underſtood as that word <hi>King</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken in the interpretations of Prophetick Viſions, when it is typified by a Beaſt; and that is not for any <hi>ſingle King,</hi> but for <hi>a whole ſeries,</hi> or ſucceſſion of them.</p>
               <p>But yet I muſt not paſs over in ſilence, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> iii. <hi>de Pont. Ro. cap.</hi> 2.) ſays, (and he does but ſay it) that in <hi>Dan.</hi> viii. by <hi>the Ram</hi> is meant <hi>Darius,</hi> the laſt <hi>Perſian</hi> King; and by the <hi>Goat</hi> the firſt King of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy; viz. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. But as for the Goat, the Angel, which interpreted the Viſion, gives him the untruth. For
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38410:30"/>the Angel tells us, That <hi>the Goat is the King of Graecia, and the great Horn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Eyes is the firſt King. verſ.</hi> 21. that is, The Goat is the Kingdom of <hi>Graecia,</hi> and the great Horn is the firſt King of that Kingdom, <hi>viz. Aleander</hi> the Great. Wherefore <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhe Great is not particularly typified by the <hi>Goat,</hi> but by the <hi>great Horn</hi> between his Eyes. And it is manifeſt that the Goat continued longer than the great Horn; for when that was broken off, there came up for it four other notable Horns upon the ſame Beaſt; that is, after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s death, his Kingdom was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four Kingdoms, as the Angel explains it, ver. 22.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Ram,</hi> that by it, is not particulariz'd the laſt King of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchy, but that the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in general is typified by it, we ſhall prove by theſe five Arguments, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Characters of the Viſion it ſelf, and the Angel's Interpretation. Firſt, The Angel interprets the <hi>Ram,</hi> at ver. 20. thus: <hi>The Ram which thou ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38410:31"/>having two Horns, are the Kings of Media and Perſia.</hi> Now if by <hi>the Ram</hi> be meant <hi>Darius</hi> only, then <hi>Darius,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Horns, are the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> Which (beſides that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible) will inſtead of making the Ram a ſingle King (which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would fain do) make <hi>Darius</hi> two Kings, to wit, one of <hi>Media,</hi> and the other of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But the plain meaning is, That by the <hi>Ram</hi> is ſignified that whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which conſiſted of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> which are repreſented by the Horns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by the <hi>Ram</hi> were particularly deſigned the laſt King of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, there is no reaſon why the Angel ſhould not have interpreted it ſo, as well as he tells us of the <hi>Goats great Horn,</hi> that it is the <hi>first King</hi> of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy. But this the Angel does not, neither does <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſign any reaſon of it. And therefore by the <hi>Ram</hi> cannot be meant <hi>Darius</hi> only, but the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy under all or any of its Kings indefinitely.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:38410:31"/>3. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaw this Ram with one Horn firſt, verſ. 3. and then the other (which proved to be the higheſt) came up after it. But of <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarch this is not true. For he was poſſeſt of both Horns together, and if of either firſt, it was of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which was the higheſt Horn, though <hi>Media</hi> were the firſt Kingdom. But they being both united into one Kingdom long before this <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his time; I ſay, they came to <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> both together. But of the whole Monarchy, that the Ram had the Horn of <hi>Media</hi> firſt, which was the firſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and then afterwards <hi>Perſia,</hi> the higheſt and the nobleſt Horn, was added to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaies at <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that he <hi>ſaw the Ram puſhing Weſtward, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Southward, ſo that no Beaſts</hi> (or Kingdoms) <hi>might ſtand before him,</hi> &amp;c. But of the Perſon of <hi>Darius</hi> this is not true; For what Kingdoms were ſubdued to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy in his time? He Reigned but ſix years, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38410:32"/>thereabouts; and in that time he fought three Battels with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and was overcome in every one of them. This then is true, if by the <hi>Ram</hi> be meant the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, but not ſo of the Perſon of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> the laſt King of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although it be ſaid of the <hi>Goat</hi> with his great Horn (to wit <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) that <hi>he came unto the Ram, and overcame him, verſ.</hi> 6, 7. which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened indeed in the time of <hi>Darius,</hi> the laſt King of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy: yet that was but caſual, as to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. For it had bin as well fulfill'd, if <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had come in the Reign of any other of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and if there had three, or four, or more <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs ſucceeded one another in the time that <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſubduing that Kingdom. For theſe things are ſpoken only of the <hi>Ram,</hi> which in the ſenſe of theſe prophetick <hi>Viſions,</hi> might have ſignified any other of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs as well as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> as hath bin before abundantly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38410:32"/>proved, and as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledgeth, while he can find no other Beaſt but this, to ſignifie a ſingle King. And therefore all theſe Reaſons againſt his only <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffice to prove what we intended.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared the matter as to the laſt of theſe <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> let us look back upon the reſt. Obſerve therefore that which is ſaid of this Beaſt, verſ. 8. <hi>The Beast that thou ſawest, was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit, and go into Perdition:</hi> and again at the end of the ſame verſe, it is called <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is.</hi> Now in regard that it is ſaid of this <hi>Beast,</hi> that after the time when this Viſion was interpreted, he ſhould <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and that he was not then in being; it follows, that <hi>the Beaſt</hi> which then <hi>was,</hi> is here conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as another <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And ſince the Beaſt was then in being only under his ſixth <hi>Head;</hi> it follows, that this ſixth <hi>Head</hi> alſo is to be conſidered as another <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and ſo to be interpreted, not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38410:33"/>of any <hi>ſingle King,</hi> but of that <hi>whole Order</hi> or Succeſſion of the Kings then reigning.</p>
               <p>The like might eaſily be proved of the <hi>ſive Kings</hi> then <hi>fallen,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, and in the ſame manner. But I need not trouble the underſtanding Reader any further with it. For the <hi>Head</hi> is ſo conſiderable a part of any Beaſt, that the falling off of the old, and coming up of any new one, may well make him to be look'd on as another <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Wherefore as this ſeven-headed Beaſt, in regard of his one body, is but one: ſo in reſpect of his ſeven ſeveral <hi>Heads,</hi> he is to be conſidered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as ſeven ſeveral <hi>Beaſts</hi> or Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Thus then, as I conceive, we have made good another mark or token of the <hi>Woman</hi> we were ſpeaking of. She <hi>is that great</hi> Imperial <hi>City which</hi> in St. <hi>John's</hi> time reigned <hi>over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> was ſituate <hi>upon ſeven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> and had, and was to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her <hi>ſeven</hi> ſeveral <hi>Heads</hi> or Orders
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38410:33"/>and ſucceſſions of <hi>Kings,</hi> which ſhould make <hi>the Beaſt</hi> ſhe ſat on, look like ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeveral Beaſts or Kingdoms; <hi>five</hi> whereof were <hi>faln</hi> in <hi>St. John</hi>'s time; <hi>one</hi> was then reigning, and then another King was to ſucceed, who ſhould be a King of like dignity with the former, but of a different temper, and therefore is not typified by any Head, ſo that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his <hi>ſhort</hi> Reign the blaſphemous <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould want an <hi>Head.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it ſhould revive again, and get another blaſphemous <hi>Head,</hi> who was to be the <hi>eighth King,</hi> and <hi>one of the ſeven Kings</hi> that are typified by the <hi>ſeven Heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I believe that there is no City in the World, nor ever was but <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom all theſe Marks and Tokens may well and truly be accommodated. But to <hi>Rome</hi> they may. And this I have ſhewed already of the foregoing Marks. I come now to ſhew the ſame of the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or <hi>Kings.</hi> Let us here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve therefore, that of the <hi>five</hi> firſt of them there is no more notice taken by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38410:34"/>the Angel, but only this, that they were <hi>faln.</hi> As for the manner of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one another, what <hi>Interregnums</hi> there have bin, and ſuch like matters, the Angel mentions not a word. So that to make our application of theſe <hi>five Kings</hi> exactly anſwerable to the Angel's Interpretation, we have no more to do but to ſhew, that before <hi>St. John</hi>'s time the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had bin go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>five</hi> ſuch ſeveral <hi>Heads,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>five</hi> were <hi>faln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Head</hi> then that had Supreme Authority in <hi>Rome,</hi> were called <hi>Kings;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Conſuls;</hi> the third, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virs;</hi> the fourth, <hi>Tribunes;</hi> the fifth, <hi>Dictators.</hi> Each of theſe ſeveral <hi>Head;</hi> had had a ſhare ſucceſſively in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Government of the <hi>Roman King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and were all <hi>fallen</hi> before the time in which this Viſion was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. One other, namely that of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors,</hi> was then in being. And theſe were the ſixth Head.</p>
               <p>Now to this ſixth Head the <hi>Roman Heathen Emperors,</hi> was to ſucceed that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38410:34"/>other King, who is not typified by any Head: who was to be a King, and of like Royal Dignity with the ſix Kings that were before him. But being of a different nature from the reſt, he is not repreſented as a Head of that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> who is ſaid at ver. 3. to have bin <hi>full of Names of Blaſphemy;</hi> but has a Type peculiar to himſelf, as we ſhall find here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the xiith and xiiith Chapters of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> where the Hiſtory of the Head that reigned in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, of this other King, not typified by any Head; and of the <hi>Beaſt that was, and is not;</hi> who is the <hi>eighth King,</hi> and <hi>one of the ſeven Kings,</hi> that are typified by the ſeven Heads, is more at large deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and foretold of.</p>
               <p>This other King then that was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between the ſixth and ſeventh Heads of the Blaſphemous Beaſt, are the Chriſtian Roman Emperors. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not guilty of the like Blaſphemy or Idolatry with the reſt (for by Blaſphemy is meant Idolatry, as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter) are not typified by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38410:35"/>any Head. The reaſon is, becauſe the Beaſt, whoſe Heads they were, is ſaid to have bin full of Names of Blaſphemy, at ver. 3. and theſe Names of Blaſphemy were written on his Heads. Which is evident from <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. where the ſame Seven-headed and ten-horned Beaſt is again deſcribed, and a Name of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is ſaid to have bin ſeen upon his Heads.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Chriſtian Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, though they were Kings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual dignity with the reſt, yet are they not deſigned by any Head, becauſe they were not Blaſphemous or Idolatrous as the others were. So that the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Beaſt did ſeem to have received a mortal Wound, and utterly to have bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, This ſeventh King, who is not typified by any Head, is expreſly noted for his ſhort continuance. Now, 'tis manifeſt that <hi>Rome</hi> has bin govern'd by ſuch as have profeſſed Chriſtianity, for above theſe thirteen hundred years. And if we call this a ſhort time, how long muſt he reign, who is to be the eighth King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is called <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> and typified by the ſeventh Blaſphemous or Idolatrous Head? But now the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, which were truly ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roman Empire was deſtroyed, continued but a little while, not half ſo long as did the Heathen Emperours,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38410:36"/>nor hardly half a quarter of the time that the ſucceeding Head has governed. And therefore we muſt reckon that he reigned but a ſhort time; becauſe there is no difference of ſhort and long, but only in comparing them with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Angel gives us a moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt deſignation of the time when the Reign of this ſeventh King (not typiſied by any Head) is to be reckoned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. For he tells us, that at the time when the Beaſt or eighth King ſhould ariſe, the ten Kings that are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by ten Horns, ſhould ariſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, verſ. 11, 12. that is, that the Roman Empire ſhould be divided into ten Kingdoms, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth, ſpeaking to that purpoſe <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:38410:36"/>not only the ſeventh King was to reign ſo ſhort a time, but alſo the ten Horns of the Roman Empire (with whom the eighth King was to begin his Reign) for neer twelve hundred Years have bin ſo branched and conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>But although the Reaſon why the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, are not typified by any Head, is, becauſe they were not Patrons of that Blaſphemy which was common to the Heads: yet there is another Reaſon to be given, why the Chriſtian Roman Emperours ſhould be reckoned as another King, and be diſtinguiſht from the Heathen Emperours that preceded them. For the firſt Chriſtian Emperour <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great new modelled the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Empire, dividing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, and appointing two Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seats, the one at <hi>Rome,</hi> the other at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor having his ordinary Reſidence at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Emperor of the Eaſtern Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> So that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire having
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38410:37"/>receiv'd this ſo notable an Alteration by the Chriſtian Emperors, theſe Chriſtian Emperours may well be look't on as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother King. But if there had bin no other difference between the Heathen and the Chriſtian Emperours but only that of their Religion, (the one perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Woman, and the other ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abetting her) it might very well have given occaſion to the Holy Spirit to make a different account of them, and to repreſent them by two ſeveral Types, which is ſufficient to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Roman Empire has bin long ſince ruined, and has for many years bin nothing but an empty title; and ſince his other King (not typified by any Head) was to continue but a little while, it is time for us now, to look out for a ſucceſſor for him, who was to be the eighth King, and one of the ſeven Heads of the Blaſphemous Beaſt. For the ſixth Head was reigning in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and I would feign know whether that Head be ſtill in being or not. If it be ſtill in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38410:37"/>then is the Blaſphemous Beaſt in being ſtill; and conſequently that Head of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is reigning (for all the Heads were to have their reſidence in <hi>Rome,</hi> as hath bin prov'd before) is the Head of that Blaſphemous Beaſt. But if that Blaſphemous Head, which reigned in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, be periſhed; I would as willingly know the time when it expired. For was it continued in the Chriſtian Emperours, or not? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that they were any part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Beaſt, which is deſcribed full of names of Blaſphemy. Wherefore that Head which in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt needs have ended in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours. Theſe therefore are that other King not typified by any Head. And ſince this King was to continue but a little while, his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, the <hi>Antichriſtian Beaſt,</hi> muſt needs be come 'ere this, and therefore we ſhall make a further ſearch after him.</p>
               <p>And here to take as much Light with us as the Text affords us, for the certain finding and diſcovering of him: Let us

                  <hi>not as yet</hi> in the former. <hi>For when the Angel had ſaid, that theſe ten Horns</hi> (or Kings) <hi>have received no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as yet;</hi> would not any one be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ask, When then ſhall they receive it? To this therefore the Angel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, when he adds immediately after, <hi>but they ſhall receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast.</hi> Hence therefore I conclude that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was to be divided into ten Horns, or ſmaller Kingdoms, much about the ſame point of time when it ſhould appear under its laſt Head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us obſerve the difference that is between the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> &amp; <hi>ten Horns.</hi> For each of the ſeven Heads was to have dominion over the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, or Kingdom: but the ten Horns are ten ſeveral Kings, that were to keep within their own reſpective bounds and limits of their ſeveral Kingdoms; and none
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38410:41"/>of them to be the Head or Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>Roman Beast</hi> or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For elſe we ſhould confound the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and make no difference between the Heads and Horns, if we ſhould make any of the ten Horns the Head: whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>the ten Horns are ten Kings,</hi> none of which ſhould be the Beaſt or laſt Head, but which ſhould <hi>receive their power as Kings together with him.</hi> So that the Beaſt, or laſt Head, was ſtill to have the Sovereignty of the whole, even then when the whole Beaſt or Kingdom was to ſtand divided into ten parts, or leſſer Kingdoms; and by conſequence to have Authority over thoſe ten Kings themſelves. Which was not to be any forcible Authority, and ſuch as Kings do ordinarily compel their Subjects to ſubmit to: but a voluntary ſubjection of the ten Kings to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is foretold of them at ver. 13. <hi>that with one mind, or one conſent, they ſhould give their power and ſtrength unto the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then as to the accompliſhment
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38410:42"/>of this Prophecy, we find that about the Year 456, the Roman Empire came to be divided into

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:38410:42"/>
               <p>But notwithſtanding I have thus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd <hi>ten Horns</hi> or Kingdoms in the Roman Empire, according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acceptation of the number <hi>ten:</hi> yet (to avoid all cavils and unneceſſary liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations touching the preciſeneſs of the number) I would nor here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to bind the expoſition of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie to an unite, but have pitch'd upon the Year 456, or thereabouts, as the moſt likely time (all circumſtances conſider'd) from which to calculate both the ruin of the Roman Empire, and the beginning of the eighth King's Reign. For in a computation of this nature ſome latitude of Years in any Reaſon ought to be allow'd. Eſpecially ſince the Kingdom of this eighth King (the Antichriſtian Beaſt,) together with the ten Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms and diviſions of the Roman Empire, was to continue for above twelve hundred Years, as will appear hereafter from the thirteenth Chapter. Now therefore in ſo long a time as this ten-horned Beaſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:38410:43"/>was to continue; the allowance of the ſpace of forty years, or half a hundred, for the fixing of his <hi>Epocha,</hi> is not much conſiderable.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Angel tells us, that the eighth King, and the ten Horns that were to give their Power and Strength and Kingdom to him, ſhould receive their Power as Kings together: the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Scripture-uſage of the number <hi>ten</hi> will eaſily admit that latitude of interpretation, and aſſigning of the <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> we contend for.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38410:43"/>nine or eight diviſions of the Roman Empire at the time that we aſſign, they would ſuffice to verifie this Propheſie, and to warrant us in our Application of it.</p>
               <p>But ſince (as hath bin ſaid) theſe ten Diviſions of the Roman Empire, more or leſs, were to continue for above twelve hundred Years; yet cannot be expected that they ſhould laſt through all that period, without the uſual fate of Neighbouring Kingdoms, who are wont to loſe and get of one another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various Fortunes and Succeſſes that attend them. Sometimes therefore we may look to find them ten; ſometimes eight; ſometimes ſix; ſometimes twelve; ſometimes fifteen or ſixteen. And all this no ways incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Propheſie, where the Beaſt is ſtill repreſented with <hi>ten</hi> Horns; this being the fitteſt number to expreſs them by, as being the moſt capable of an indefinite acceptation, of any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereabouts.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe when the Angel tells us
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38410:44"/>of the agreement of theſe ten Horns, or Kingdoms and diviſions of the Roman Empire to give their ſtrength and power to the Beaſt: We cannot think the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel means, that they ſhould all conſpire throughout the aforeſaid period to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intereſt of the Beaſt. But it ſuffices, that they all came to it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; that from the very firſt this plot was laid, and by the Policy of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhops took effect within a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſpace of time, proportionable to the term their headſhip was to laſt; and that all the Kingdoms and diviſions of the Roman Empire have from time to time ſo far ſubmitted, and advanc'd the Intereſt and the Grandure of theſe Biſhops, that it is rather to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World that they have bin ſo much, then any prejudice to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of this Propheſie, that they have bin no more obſequious to them. And thus much I thought good to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here by way of explication of the ten Horns, and of what the Angel has foretold concerning them. But we
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38410:44"/>may have occaſion to ſay more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the explication of the xiii Chapter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that this diviſion of the Roman Empire into theſe ten Kingdoms, was no caſual or ordinary mutation, but that the hand of God was eminently conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the effecting of it, to the end the Scriptures might be fulfilled: I ſhall here ſubjoyn that obſervation of the learned Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> upon theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which we find in his deſcription of <hi>Italy:</hi> and the rather becauſe he was a perſon, (who as far as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Writings) did not think of any Accompliſhment of this or any other Prophecy in theſe great Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. His words are theſe:
<q>Their ſins, (ſaith he) that is, the ſins of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and thoſe other Weſtern parts, being ripe for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; God ſent the Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his Executioners, to execute his Divine Juſtice on the impenitent Men, and made them ſenſible, though Heathens, that it was God's work,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38410:45"/>they did, and not their own, in laying ſuch Afflictions on theſe Weſtern Parts. <hi>Ipſi fatebantur non ſuum eſſe quod facerent, agi enim ſe &amp; perurgeri divino juſſu,</hi> as <hi>Salvian</hi> that Godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop does inform us of them. On this impulſion the <hi>Vandals</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they firſt waſted <hi>Spain,</hi> and then harried <hi>Africk,</hi> and at the ſame time did <hi>Attila</hi> the <hi>Hun</hi> inſert into his Royal Titles the ſtyle of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus Orbis,</hi> and <hi>Flagellum Dei;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thereby his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſome ſpecial and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary calling to this publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Nay, as <hi>Jornandes</hi> doth report, ſome of theſe Barbarous People did not ſtick to ſay, That they were put on by ſome Heavenly Viſions, which did direct them to the Work which they were to do. In proſecution of which, in leſs time then the compaſs of eighty years, this very <hi>Italy</hi> (though anciently the ſtrength and ſeat of that Empire) was ſeven times brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſt to Deſolation by the Fire and Sword of the Barbarians.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:38410:45"/>
               <p>And thus much I thought good to advertiſe the Reader of concerning the wonderful Providence of God, in the ordering and diſpoſing of theſe events. For it is very apt to perſuade any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering perſon, that God had a more than ordinary concern in this ſo ſtrange a work; and what can that more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be thought to have bin, than the accompliſhment of his Word? For it is certain that this Propheſie we are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, had a great and ſignal verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and accompliſhment in it.</p>
               <p>Having thus noted the preciſe time (as neer as a matter of this nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of) when the Roman Empire began to be divided into <hi>ten Horns</hi> or <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and when the full number of them came to be conſummate; which appeareth to have bin done within the ſpace of <hi>Forty ſix Years</hi> (a very ſhort time for the effecting of ſo great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in that potent Monarchy) let us now return to that great <hi>City</hi> we were ſpeaking of, to ſee if we can find therein another Head, to be a Succeſſor
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38410:46"/>to the former King in the ſupream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this once intire, but now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ten-horn'd Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And here it is to be obſerved, that when the Roman Empire came to be divided into ten Horns, or Kingdoms, he that is maſter but of one of theſe Kingdoms, though it were the moſt conſiderable of them all, yet can he not be accounted any more than a Horn, and therefore not the Head that we are ſeeking for. For this Head we now ſpeak of, is not the Head of any one Kingdom only, but of the whole Beaſt or Kingdom, as it ſtands divided into ten Horns, or leſſer Kingdoms. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the ten Horns, there was to be a ſeventh or laſt Head to whom the Horns ſhould <hi>give their power and ſtrength,</hi> ver. 13. So that as all the other ſix forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heads, had been the Heads of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire then entire, ſo might this laſt Head alſo be a kind of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or univerſal Head, by the conſent or favour of the ten partial or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:38410:46"/>
               <p>And to make this yet more clear, let us have recourſe to another inſtance much like this in <hi>Dan.</hi> viii. where <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and firſt founder of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, is typified by a <hi>great Horn:</hi> and though after him <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſucceeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> yet becauſe the Empire of <hi>Alexander</hi> was then divided into four Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms, whereof <hi>Caſſander's</hi> was but one, he is not reckoned in the ſame account with <hi>Alexander</hi> for ſucceeding him, in his Seat Imperial, and Title of King of <hi>Macedon;</hi> but becauſe he was poſſeſt of but a part of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Empire, the Scripture makes no reckoning of his Kingdom, more than of any other of the four Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms. When therefore, in our preſent caſe, the Roman Empire once entirely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by its Emperours and preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings, was come to be divided into ten Horns or Kingdoms, as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told it ſhould: no Man ſucceeding them whether in the Imperial Seat or Title,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38410:47"/>ſo long as he poſſeſſes but one of the ten Horns or Kingdoms, can be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd with the former Emperours as the Head, but only as a Horn or ſmaller Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And now by this time we have made our way ſo plain to this our laſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that I ſuppoſe that I ſhall meet with very few Readers, though never ſo inexpert almoſt in theſe affairs, but can reſolve me this Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Who it was, that having his Imperial Seat, or ordinary reſidence in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was Succeſſour to the Chriſtian Roman Emperours, (at what time that once mighty Empire came to be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Horns or leſſer Kingdoms,) in the Headſhip or Supremacy not of any Horn or ſmaller Kingdom, but in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Roman Empire; and to whom thoſe Horns or partial Kings by voluntary Contribution (as it were) did give their Power and Strength. If thou art a Proteſtant, I know partly what thou wilt ſay; and if thou art a Romaniſt, I know partly what thine
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38410:47"/>own Conſcience will ſuggeſt to thee, That it was the Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely thou art not much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thy Judgment of him. For he it was who for ſome years before this time, but eſpecially under the gentler Government of the Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, had been contending earneſtly for this Supremacy, and laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Greatneſs, by encroaching on the Chriſtian Churches. But while the Empire flouriſhed, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had their reſidence in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſo obſcur'd the Glories of their Biſhop that he was never but an Underling in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p>But now about the Year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten, when <hi>Rome</hi> was ſack't and ſet on Fire; at what time ſix of the ten Horns began to come upon the Stage: that the ſeventh or laſt Head might ſhew it ſelf in <hi>Rome</hi> together with them, (ſee by how wonderful a Providence theſe things have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Honorius</hi> the then Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38410:48"/>himſelf to <hi>Ravenna;</hi> (his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours following his example) and (as it were in token of their future Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) he left the ancient Seat of Empire to the Roman Biſhops. From which time forward the Roman Empire ſtill declined, till about the Year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty ſix it was utterly ruined, and thoſe few Emperours that ſucceeded were of no account. But for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Biſhop he was ſtill riſing as the Empire was declining. Inſomuch that <hi>Leo</hi> who preſided in the Roman See even in that very year 456, wherein (as we have ſaid) the ten Horns were riſen and the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ruined, is found to have boaſted in his Sermon <hi>de Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolis,</hi> That the Temporal Government of the Roman Emperours was chang'd into the power of <hi>Roman See.</hi> It hath not bin my happineſs yet to get a ſight of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Sermons: but this paſſage I find quoted in Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi>'s <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Appeal for Protestants, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5 <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. in theſe very words; <hi>In cuj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38410:50"/>it is well obſerved by <hi>Hadrianus Valeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> That the Pope durſt not thus have affronted the Emperour in confidence of his own Strength, but by a precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Power, and under the Protection of a Private Correſpondency which he held at that time with <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> whoſe Honour and Arms were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in theſe Weſtern parts.

               </p>
               <p>Not long after the Pope takes upon him to authoriſe <hi>Pepin</hi> Son of the ſaid <hi>Charles Martel</hi> to depoſe his lawful King <hi>Childeric,</hi> and uſurp his Kingdom; and when this was done, he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abſolved by the Pope from his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38410:51"/>Oath of Fidelity, with all the Nobles and People. And thus poor King <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> had his Poll ſhaven, and was thruſt into a Monaſtery, <hi>Pepin</hi> ſucceeding by the Pope's Authority.</p>
               <p>And further; That the Pope might make the cleareſt demonſtration of his Headſhip in the World; having thus exalted himſelf above the Emperours of <hi>Greece,</hi> depos'd the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſet up <hi>Pepin</hi> in his room, with ſome ſuch notable exploits: that he might ſhew himſelf the very ſource and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Power and Greatneſs in the Roman Empire, he undertakes upon his own Authority to create a Roman Emperour, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſerts upon the teſtimony of no leſs then three and thirty Authours, ſome of them Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſome Popes, ſome Emperours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

               <p>But we need the leſs to labour in this Argument, becauſe the Romaniſts themſelves have done it ſo abundantly to our hands. For it would grieve ones Heart to ſee how <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> have ſweat in large Voluminous Works, to magnifie the greatneſs of their Biſhop, and unawares to prove him <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let any Man ſhew, if he be able, where-ever any Pope, before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Honorius</hi> his time, or indeed for ſome years after, (for the Popes did not preſently arrive at the height of their affected Grandure) depoſed any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, whether <hi>Heathen, Arrian,</hi> or <hi>Eutichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Perſecutor, or abſolved their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Allegiance to them, or took away any part of their Demeſnes

But if this cannot be done, we muſt conclude, That before <hi>Honorius</hi> his time, (who left the Seat Imperial to the Pope) the Pope was never Head in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the Roman Empire: but ſince that time he is, and hath declared it abundantly to all the World; and we have ſeen it evidently fulfilled in him, how all the Princes of the Roman Empire, ſince it came to be divided, have truckled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and ſubmitted in a ſhameful meaſure their Royal Diadems and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him. Wherefore the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is that very ſeventh or laſt Head of the Roman Beaſt or Kingdom, who was to appear upon the Stage, together with the ten Horns or ſmaller King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in which the Roman Empire was to be divided, and to whom thoſe ten Kings were to give their Power and Strength.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the ſeven Heads

               <p>But poſſibly it may be objected, that ſome of theſe were not <hi>Kings,</hi> and that eſpecially <hi>Conſuls, Decemvirs,</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> are very improperly called by that name.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That they may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be called Kings, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Supream Government, which began in Kings, was devolved upon every one of theſe ſucceſſively, ſo that they all enjoyed the ſame power as Kings.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the names of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are uſed in ſuch a lattitude, as to comprehend all ſorts of State sand Supream Governours, as when the Tempter is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> IV. to have <hi>ſhewed</hi> our Saviour <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World,</hi> by <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are meant <hi>all ſorts of Supream Governments,</hi> whether <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchieal, Ariſtocratical,</hi> or <hi>Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> So the Roman Empire is called in <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. the fourth <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and is there typified by the <hi>fourth Beast,</hi> which with the other three, are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted <hi>four Kings,</hi> although the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kingdom hath not bin governed by <hi>Monarchs</hi> only, but by <hi>Conſuls, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirs,</hi> and <hi>Tribunes;</hi> the general name of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> including all the other ſorts of Supream Governours. Thus alſo, where it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10, 11. <hi>The Kings of</hi> Tarſhiſh <hi>and of the Iſles ſhall bring Preſents: the Kings of</hi> Sheba, <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>ſhall offer Gifts; Yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all

Many other places of Scripture might be produced to this purpoſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.15. but I will not give my ſelf a needleſs trouble in a thing ſo common, and ſo obvious to every eye.</p>
               <p>But it may be, it will further be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That <hi>Rome</hi> had enjoyed more ſorts of Supream Governments than <hi>five,</hi> and all of them fall'n before St. <hi>John</hi>'s time. For there had bin alſo a <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi> managed by the joint Forces and Counſels of <hi>Auguſtus, Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius.</hi> But this laſting but a very little while, and being but the paſſage to the greatneſs of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and, which is more obſervable, being only an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Commonwealth, and not a Government eſtabliſhed by the conſent of the Senate, and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:38410:56"/>as all the other five had bin, it ought not in any reaſon to be numbred with them. And this I look upon as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Account of thoſe <hi>five</hi> Kings that were <hi>fall'n:</hi> becauſe the Angel does not deſcend to any particularities concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but only ſays in general words, that <hi>five were faln.</hi> And ſo much for them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the main ſtreſs of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument depends upon the right inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of theſe <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the <hi>ſixth</hi> of them, (which was then reigning when this Viſion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to St. <hi>John</hi>) whether he were a <hi>ſingle King,</hi> or the <hi>whole Order</hi> and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the ſame kind of Kings: We ſhall therefore in particular demonſtrate further concerning this <hi>ſixth King,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>ſeventh King,</hi> who is not typified by any Head, that it cannot be meant of any two particular Kings, but of as many Orders and Succeſſions of them.</p>
               <p>For it is certain that this Viſion was ſhew'd to St. <hi>John</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38410:56"/>by Heathen Emperors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor affirming it to have bin later, that I know of. If therefore <hi>Domitian</hi> were the ſixth King then reigning; <hi>Nerva</hi> muſt be the other, who was not then <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>when he came,</hi> was to <hi>continue but a little while; and the Beast which was, and is not,</hi> and is interpreted the <hi>eighth</hi> or laſt King, will happen on't to be the Emperor <hi>Trajanus,</hi> who reigned about the beginning of the ſecond Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. But the Angel tells us, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Beaſt, the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was to be divided into ten Horns, or ſmaller Kingdoms, which were <hi>to give their Power and Strength unto the Beaſt.</hi> But theſe ten Horns did not ariſe till above three hundred years after <hi>Trajan's</hi> time; and therefore cannot the ſixth and ſeventh Kings be underſtood of any two ſingle Kings apart from other of the ſame Order; but of the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Succeſſion of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, <hi>Heathen</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> according as we have before declared.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:38410:57"/>And conſequently the <hi>five</hi> that were <hi>fallen,</hi> muſt be ſuch too, to wit, not <hi>five ſingle Kings,</hi> but <hi>five Orders or Succeſſions</hi> of <hi>five ſeveral ſorts of Kings.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs be thoſe that I have named; or if any Man can aſſign five other ſuch, he ſhall have my free conſent.</p>

               <p>But never was an Expoſition in the World ſo huddled up together, as this is.

So that by his reckoning we cannot account all the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> fewer in number than one hundred and thirty, I ſpeak within compaſs. Now is it not very ſtrange that <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> ſhould be put
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38410:58"/>to ſignifie one hundred and thirty? For let us grant that <hi>ſeven,</hi> a certain number, may be put for an uncertain: yet who ever heard that ſo ſmall a number as ſeven, hath bin put for ſo great a one, as hath bin the number <hi>of all the Roman Emperors?</hi> This therefore is one great Abſurdity, but not comparable to thoſe which follow.</p>
               <p>For if by theſe <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> are meant <hi>all the Roman Emperors,</hi> then why does not the Cardinal proceed to ſhew us, which be thoſe <hi>five</hi> that were <hi>fallen;</hi> which is the <hi>one</hi> that <hi>was;</hi> which the other that was not then <hi>come, who when he was come, ſhould continue but a ſhort ſpace,</hi> and which is the <hi>Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> who is ſaid to be the <hi>eighth King,</hi> and yet to be of <hi>the ſeven?</hi> All which particulars of the Angel's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation the Cardinal has thought fit to ſmother in profound ſilence, leſt the vanity and abſurdity of his Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be too apparent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible.</p>

And if any
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38410:59"/>Man can make ſenſe of this Expoſition, let him enjoy it for his pains. Certainly it was for meer ſhame that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> went no further in his application of theſe ſeven Kings; and if we had not minded more the truth then good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we had not thus expos'd it to the World.</p>
               <p>But I believe the Cardinal has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a greater errour yet againſt his own Principles than poſſibly he might be aware of. For if the ſeven Kings typified by the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt, be ſet to ſignifie all the Roman Emperors, and if the preſent Emperors be of that number, (as he himſelf would have them) then are the preſent Roman Emperors typified by ſome one or other of the Heads. But of the Beaſt here mentioned, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, it is ſaid that he was <hi>full of names of Blaſphemy.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 1. it is ſaid of the ſame Beaſt, that he had <hi>upon his Heads</hi> (not on any one, but on all of them, for there is none excepted) <hi>a name of Blaſphemy.</hi> And
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38410:60"/>therefore the preſent Roman Emperors, if they be any of thoſe <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> which are typified by the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> they alſo have <hi>this name of Blaſphemy</hi> in common with the reſt.</p>
               <p>Neither will it here ſuffice to ſay, that it is only noted, that the Beaſt had <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Heads a name of Blaſphemy,</hi> but not that he had the ſame upon <hi>all</hi> his Heads; So that it will be true, if <hi>any</hi> of the Roman Emperors had it. This anſwer will not ſerve. For the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors have reigned neer five times as long again, as the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors had done. And therefore there is no likelihood at all that the Spirit ſhould ſay of the Heads in general, that they had the <hi>name of Blaſphemy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinguiſhing of them, if either he had underſtood by the ſeven Heads, the whole Order of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> reckons them,) or if the preſent Emperors be not, and have not bin guilty of this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in common with the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:38410:60"/>
               <p>As for what the Cardinal adds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> or <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which ſaith he, <hi>ſhall reign together at the ſame time,</hi> the Angel tells us more preciſely that they ſhould reign <hi>together with the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>ſeventh</hi> and laſt Head. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> having not thought fit to tell us which of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are this Beaſt, or ſeventh and laſt Head: he does not ſay as the Angel does, that the <hi>ten Horns</hi> ſhould <hi>reign to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Beaſt,</hi> but only that they ſhould <hi>reign together at one time.</hi> And thus again he has very pitifully ſhuffled in the moſt meterial point of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. And this he has done, leſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has expounded the <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> to be <hi>all the Roman Emperors,</hi> we ſhould ſuſpect the preſent Roman Emperors to be that Antichriſtan Beaſt, whom the Angel calls the <hi>eighth</hi> and laſt of thoſe Kings; for if <hi>ſix</hi> of them were come in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and the <hi>other</hi> ſhould <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but a little while;</hi> the <hi>eighth</hi> and laſt, who is the Antichriſtian Beaſt, muſt needs be come by this, or he is never to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38410:61"/>be look't for. Since therefore by the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Kings</hi> are meant <hi>all the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> muſt be the ſixth; <hi>Nerva</hi> muſt be the other, who was to continue but a ſhort time; and all the Emperors ſucceeding <hi>Nerva,</hi> and by conſequence the new Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the Popes Creatures and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, muſt be the Antichriſtian Beaſt, or the <hi>eighth</hi> and laſt of thoſe Kings.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds, concerning the ten Horns, that they ſhould not be <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kings, becauſe they ſhould hate the Whore,</hi> (i.e. <hi>the City of</hi> Rome) <hi>and make her deſolate:</hi> it is as unintelligible as the reſt. For, does he mean that they ſhall not be Kings in <hi>Rome?</hi> Who ever ſaid it? Or does he mean, that they ſhould not poſſeſs each one his portion of the Roman Empire? Himſelf confeſſeth it Or laſtly does he mean, that none o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> them <hi>ſhould be,</hi> or <hi>ſhould be called</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man King? How does he prove it? He ſaies, <hi>they ſhall not be Roman Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall hate the Whore,</hi> (i.e. <hi>the City of</hi> Rome) <hi>and make her deſolate.</hi> But
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38410:61"/>this they may do, though any one, or all of them <hi>ſhould be,</hi> or (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf expreſſes it) <hi>ſhould be called</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kings, when once they come to be enlightened, and to perceive how that adulterous City hath poiſoned, and infected, and beſotted them with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Cup of Spiritual Fornication.</p>
               <p>As for what he further adds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ten Kings, proving that they ſhould not be <hi>Roman Kings,</hi> becauſe they ſhall ſo divide the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire among them, as utterly to deſtroy it: which he gathers from what is ſaid of them <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and make her deſolate:</hi> it is to be obſerved, that theſe ten Kings were not to bring this deſolation upon that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh City, till after that they had <hi>given their power unto the Beaſt,</hi> (who was to be the laſt Head or King in that City) and had made <hi>war with the Lamb,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lamb</hi> had <hi>overcome them.</hi> For till this, 'tis ſaid, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>put into their minds to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their Kingdom to the Antichriſtian Beaſt;</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:38410:62"/>until by their warring with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and being <hi>overcome</hi> by him, <hi>the words of God</hi> ſhould <hi>be fulfilled, ver.</hi> 17. for ſo it had bin foretold of them, at v. 13. that <hi>they</hi> ſhould <hi>have one mind, and ſhould give their power and ſtrength unto the Beaſt;</hi> that <hi>they</hi> ſhould <hi>make War with the Lamb,</hi> and that <hi>the Lamb</hi> ſhould <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</hi> And being thus worſted by the <hi>Lamb,</hi> when they ſhould come to ſee their Errour, they ſhould hate the Whoriſh City, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Beaſt, that had ſeduc'd them, and in revenge of her impiety, ſhould <hi>make her deſolate, and naked, and ſhould eat her fleſh, and burn her with Fire.</hi> Theſe ten Kings therefore might be Roman Kings for all their laying of that City deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: becauſe they ſhould not do it, till after they had ſpy'd their Errour in confederating with her.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, If theſe ten Kings ſhall ſo divide the Roman Empire among them as utterly to deſtroy it; how can it then be ſaid, that they ſhould <hi>give their Power and Strength, and Kingdom to the</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:38410:62"/>Roman Emperors? For if by the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or Kings be meant (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us) <hi>all the Roman Emperors;</hi> then muſt the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of thoſe Kings be ſome, or one at leaſt, of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. But it is manifeſt from, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. that the <hi>ſeventh</hi> of thoſe Heads or Kings, is <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not;</hi> to whom, it is ſaid in the next verſe but one, that the ten Kings ſhould <hi>give their Power and Strength,</hi> (nay, and their <hi>Kingdom</hi> alſo, as is ſaid a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) If then theſe ten Kings ſhall <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to the Roman Emperors; how ſhall they ſo divide the Roman Empire among themſelves, as utterly to deſtroy it? And thus much of the Cardinal's Expoſition, which indeed is utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Judgment of ſo great a Diſputant: but we muſt pardon this, and many other ſuch-like failings, to the weakneſs of his Cauſe. For certainly it cannot be aſcribed to any other thing, that <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> a Man ſo learned, ſo ripe of Judgment, quick of Wit, and skilful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38410:63"/>in the Art that he profeſt, ſhould be ſo utterly puzled and confounded in this Argument above all others (though in others alſo not a little) even to the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and moſt palpable effects of Dotage and Stupidity.</p>

               <p>HAving thus acquitted my ſelf of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Expoſition of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, who may well be thought our greateſt Adverſary in this Argument; I cannot pretermit (tho I would feign have pretermitted it) that Expoſition which <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> and after him the learned <hi>Dr. Hammond,</hi> (who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the pains to perfect and digeſt the <hi>Poſthumous</hi> and imperfect Notions of the former) have offered in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the <hi>Revelation:</hi> to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38410:63"/>of which their Expoſition, I am the more obliged, becauſe it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to that which I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aſſerted, but alſo the Authors and Propugners of it are Men of great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the Reformed Churches, who cannot reaſonably be thought to have invented, and aſſerted it in favour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only for the evidence of the truth, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it carrys with it.</p>
               <p>This Reverend Author then, in his <hi>Premonition</hi> to the Revelation, and in his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> and <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the xviith Chapter of that Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the great City, ſituate upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mountains, to be <hi>Rome,</hi> does thus expound the ſeven Heads, which the Angel interprets to be ſeven Kings; Theſe ſeven Kings, ſaies he, are eight Roman Emperors, namely, <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Veſpaſian, Titus</hi> and <hi>Domitian.</hi> The five that were faln when this Viſion was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, were <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius.</hi> The one which was

               <p>But againſt this way of Explicating this Prophecy, there are ſo many and ſo great Reaſons, that I know not where to begin, or where to make an end with them. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is a notable prejudice againſt this Expoſition, that this Prophecy, ſo punctually interpreted by the Angel, as is no other Viſion in the Revelation, and having bin fulfilled in <hi>Domitian's</hi> Reign, that is, about one Thouſand and ſix hundred years ago, ſhould never yet have bin interpreted of <hi>Domitia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if this Propheſie ſo interpreted by the Angel, has not bin underſtood in ſixteen hundred years, that it has bin fulfilled; how can we think that any other Viſion not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted hath bin underſtood? But Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſpeaks in general of the Book of the Revelation, that it was written for the comfort of the Chriſtians of thoſe times, while they were daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with Perſecutions. But alas! what comfort from ſuch Propheſies, and particularly from this Viſion we are now treating of, if none of thoſe that were concerned in them, could attain their meaning? I ſuppoſe it therefore ablolutely neceſſary for the credit of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38410:65"/>this Expoſition, that it be ſhewn, that in thoſe early days of Chriſtianity, the Church of God, which was ſo nearly concern'd in this Propheſie, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it as the Doctor has explain'd it. For elſe indeed 'twere a great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Propheſie it ſelf, if having bin fulfill'd theſe ſixteen hundred years, although it be ſo punctually interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Angel, yet all that while the Church could never underſtand it.

               <p n="2">2. If we ſhould let this worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor have his way, yet when all is done, he makes ſo cold, ſo flat a ſtory of this greateſt and moſt noble Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as it ſeems to be by that ceremonious entrance, apt to raiſe ones expectation, which is prefixed to it at the beginning of the Chapter: by that magnificent deſcription which is made of the Viſion it ſelf, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſes: and by that Divine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which the Angel has ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it: that I know not how his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to <hi>Domitian</hi> ſhould (I ſay
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38410:65"/>not paſs for current, but even) admit of an Excuſe.</p>
               <p>For what think we is the main thing that he affirms to have bin repreſented to <hi>St. John</hi> in this Viſion?

               <p>As for the ten Horns that were to receive Power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt <hi>Domitian;</hi> he complains that he cannot make that out for want of Hiſtories to inform him in theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:38410:66"/>that is, according to the Doctor's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it ſhould be matter of great aſtoniſhment to all that were not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when they beheld <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who was in Power at <hi>Rome,</hi> while his Father went into <hi>Judea;</hi> and is not now, his Father having reaſſum'd it to himſelf, and yet is a private perſon. This therefore being every way ſo lame and ſhort-ſighted a buſineſs, as it is thus made out, we cannot in any reaſon think it to be the meaning of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Viſion, here preſented to our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Prophet by the Miniſtery of an Angel. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As theſe Authors have ordered the matter, the Angel's Interpretation is very inſignificant; becauſe he has not noted the preciſe time, when this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was interpreted: for if the ſeven Kings be ſo many ſingle Emperors, to what purpoſe is it to tell us, <hi>Five are faln, one is, and the other is not yet come,</hi> &amp;c. without aſſuring us which of them is that one, of whom the Angel tells us, that he is? For it is moſt certain, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38410:67"/>if this Viſion were not interpreted in <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Reign, of whom they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret theſe words of the Angel, One is, meaning that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> then reigned, when this Viſion was interpreted: there cannot be a word of truth, no, nor of common ſenſe in all their Expoſition. For then it cannot be ſaid of the five that were faln, that they were <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius;</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> that <hi>is,</hi> that he was <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> or that <hi>Titus</hi> was the other, not then come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, if this Viſion were not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted not only in <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Reign, but in that very point of it which hapned after his return from <hi>Judea,</hi> and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumption of the Government from his Son <hi>Domitian</hi> to himſelf: it cannot be ſaid of <hi>Domitian,</hi> as they diſtinguiſh of him very ſubtilly, that he was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and is not now an Emperor, and yet is a private perſon. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knowledge of the preciſe time, when this Viſion was interpreted, is ſo neceſſary to the certain underſtanding of it, according to their way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38410:67"/>it; and yet the Angel amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other particularities, has utterly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ſo neceſſary a buſineſs here, and ſo uſual in other Prophecies, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is not altogether ſo neceſſary: we cannot but think that there is a greater latitude of time to be allowed in the explication of this Prophecie, and muſt be forced to reject this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a reproach to the Angel's interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>But hold a little, it may be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor can aſſure us that this Viſon was interpreted by the Angel, at that very point of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Reign, which makes for his purpoſe, and which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted. But there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For in his Premonition to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> he is very ſolicitous about this very circumſtance of the time, and can find but two Opinions of the Ancients (the only competent Witneſſes in this affair) concerning it; and both of them equally inconſiſtent with this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The one is that of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> who affirms St. <hi>John</hi> to have propheſied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38410:68"/>the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign. And if ſo, it could not then be ſaid of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> that he was Emperour, and is not Emperor. For if this Viſion were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in <hi>Domitian's</hi> Reign, then muſt <hi>Domitian</hi> be the <hi>one</hi> that <hi>is; Nerva</hi> the other <hi>not yet come; Trajan</hi> the Beaſt that <hi>was, and is not,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Veſpaſian,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the <hi>five</hi> that are <hi>faln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he has a prety fetch for this: for he tells us, That by the end of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's</hi> Reign, may be meant the end of his former Reign while he reigned for his Father <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> But beſides that this reflects upon the credit of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> who makes no ſuch diſtinction, and therefore ſhould in all reaſon be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign, while he reigned for himſelf: yet for once let this be granted, and let us ſee what can be made of it for the advantage of this Expoſition. For thus alſo <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> cannot be the Beaſt, which was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and is not Emperor; but he muſt be the <hi>one</hi> that <hi>is; Veſpaſian</hi> (after his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38410:68"/>return) the other, not yet come, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 'tis certain that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> muſt needs have bin come to the Imperial Dignity before he could depute <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> in his ſtead) and <hi>Titus</hi> muſt be the Beaſt that <hi>was, and is not,</hi> &amp;c. And thus the Expoſition cannot ſtand if there be any truth in the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who affirms St. <hi>John</hi> to have propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign; whether we underſtand it of his former Reign for <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> or of his latter for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Although I cannot forbear to give the Reader notice that we have done this Expoſition no ſmall favour, when we allow <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign ſimply and abſolutely ſo called, to be interpreted of that Reign which he adminiſtred as <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s Deputy, and not rather of that other while he reigned for himſelf. To which we may add that <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Deputative authority was ſo ſhort, that the beginning and the end of it are hardly diſtinguiſhable, as to this matter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Propheſying. For <hi>Veſpaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:38410:69"/>leaving his Son <hi>Titus</hi> to beſiege <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> returned from his Expedition to <hi>Rome</hi> again in the firſt Year of his Reign. Neither is there any Author, that affirmeth St. <hi>John</hi> to have bin baniſhed into the Iſle of <hi>Patmos</hi> (where he received his Revelation, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teſtifieth) at this time, or near it.</p>
               <p>The Doctor therefore would feign take Sanctuary in the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who affirms St. <hi>John</hi> to have bin baniſhed into <hi>Patmos</hi> by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Claudius,</hi> and to have returned from his baniſhment in the Reign of the ſame Emperor. And he makes ſo much of this Teſtimony, that he endeavour to confirm it, and to diſparage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Teſtimony of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> by no leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How alſo could <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> be the one, that then reigned? Or <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> be the Beaſt, that was Emperor, and is not Emperor? Nothing you ſee hits right, according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and yet the Doctor had much rather his Teſtimony ſhould be credited, than that of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>St. John,</hi> to have propheſied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign. Becauſe, although both their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies be very inconſiſtent with his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> yet he had rather make <hi>St. John,</hi> to have propheſied of a thing to come, as it was in the Reign of <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> than of a thing paſt, or preſent, as it muſt needs have bin, according to his Expoſition, towards the end of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s Reign. For he makes the main of this Prophecy to have bin fulfilled in <hi>Domitian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, how does he ſalve up thoſe great Abſurdities, which we have ſhewn
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38410:70"/>to follow upon ſuppoſal of the truth of <hi>Ephiphanius</hi>'s Teſtimony? Why thus; If <hi>St. John</hi> receiv'd his Viſion in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> we may very well ſuppoſe him to have committed it to writing in the Reign of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> after his return from <hi>Judea.</hi> So that although he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the <hi>Viſion</hi> before any of the Kings were faln, yet he wrote it not till the ſixth of them was come. The Doctor brings no Proof of this, but ſuch a thing he ſuppoſes poſſible: and if it be but poſſible, he will have it current.</p>
               <p>But this which he here ſuppoſes in his <hi>Premonition, viz.</hi> That <hi>St. John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his Viſions in one Emperour's Reign, and committed them to writing in another's; he ſeems to have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by that time he was arriv'd at the Expoſition of the tenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For there at ver. 4. we have theſe words of St. <hi>John, And when the ſeven Thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from Heaven ſaying unto me, Write them not.</hi> Upon which words the Doctor thus
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38410:70"/>paraphraſeth:
<q>And as I had before written what I had ſeen and heard, ſo now I was about to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Whence it appears, even from his own Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>St. John</hi> as ſoon as he had ſeen and heard his Prophecies, committed them to writing. And therefore it is a little vainly ſuppos'd by him, that <hi>St. John</hi> receiv'd his Prophecies in one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Reign, and committed them to writing in another's.</p>
               <p>But, if you pleaſe, let us ſuppoſe that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote ſome Prophecies ſo ſoon as he had ſeen and heard them, but did not ſo in our preſent caſe: or that he wrote them foul, ſo ſoon as he had ſeen and heard them, but did not write them fair afterwards. Now then let us examin upon this ſuppoſition how well this explication will agree with thoſe words of the Angel, which we have, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 8. <hi>The Beaſt which thou ſaweſt, was, and is not; and again, The Beaſt which was, and is not, and yet is;</hi> and again a little after, <hi>The ſeven Heads</hi> (ſaies the Angel) <hi>are ſeven Kings;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38410:71"/>five are faln; one is; the other is not yet come; and the Beaſt which was, and is not, he is the eighth,</hi> &amp;c. That theſe are the very words which the Angel ſpake to St <hi>John,</hi> is affirmed by St. <hi>John,</hi> at <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Let us ſuppoſe then that the Angel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this Viſion towards the end of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s deputative Reign, while he reigned by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian</hi>'s Authority. But how could it then be true of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> (for of him he underſtands it) what the Angel ſaies of the Beaſt, <hi>That he was, and is not, and yet is?</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctor's Paraphraſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's meaning muſt be this: <hi>Domitian</hi> was an Emperor, and is not now an Emperor, and yet is a private Perſon. Which words, ſuppoſing them to have been ſpoken towards the end of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s former Reign, can have neither ſence, nor truth in them. For if <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> then firſt reigned, how could he mean of him, that he was an Emperor, and is not an Emperor, and yet is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſon. But if the Teſtimony of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> be true (which the Doctor
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38410:71"/>moſt contends for) viz. That St. <hi>John</hi> propheſied in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> who is the firſt of the eight Kings; how can it be true what St. <hi>John</hi> recites as the Angel's words, at <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Five are faln,</hi> viz. <hi>Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius; one is,</hi> viz. <hi>Veſpaſian?</hi> So that we muſt be forced to admit either that the Angel did not exactly deſcribe the time, or that St. <hi>John</hi> has not ſet down the Angel's words, or laſtly, that this expoſition of them is not good.</p>
               <p>And indeed he ſaw full well, that with all that he could do, he could not make the Time agree to his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, for he as good as confeſſeth it in his <hi>Premonition,</hi> telling us, That in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſome uncertainty he may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken as to the particularity of Time. But it is evident, that whoſoever is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this circumſtance of the Time, can make no ſence at all of the Angel's words, who has ſo punctually deſigned the Times, paſt, preſent, and to come, throughout his whole Interpretation.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:38410:72"/>
               <p>But it were pity to omit (and I had like to have omitted it) that excellent Artifice, which the Doctor uſeth as his fourth and laſt Argument, to prove what time this Viſion was received in. For in his <hi>Premonition</hi> he proves that it was receiv'd, or at leaſt committed to writing at ſuch time as he would have it, becauſe it will not elſe be applicable to thoſe eight Emperors that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it of. So that he takes it for granted, that this Prophecy cannot be otherwiſe interpreted than of thoſe eight Kings, and therefore muſt have bin written at a time agreeable. Which Argument, as it is an odd illogical way of reaſoning: ſo it can prove nothing but this, that the Doctor was ſo fond of this conceit, that nothing could remove him from it.</p>
               <p>Certainly therefore he imagined that there was ſome extraordinary agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it with all other circumſtances of this Prophecy, that he would needs retain it in deſpite of all the aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned abſurdities we have prov'd it guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38410:72"/>of. We therefore come now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a further examination of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. From this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the Doctor gives us no good account, why St. <hi>John</hi> was carried by the Angel into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> (as is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 3.) to ſee this Viſion of the Woman. He ſeems to hint a Reaſon in his Paraphraſe upon that verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was carried into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> as a fit place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Deſolation that was to be expreſſed in this Viſion. So that it ſeems this Deſolation (as he calls it) was to be expreſſed in the Viſion, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> As if the place whither he was carried in Spirit to ſee the Viſion, were intended for a Type of that which is expreſſed in the Viſion. Now this were an excellent Reaſon why this Viſion was repreſented in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> if it could be proved that the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> (for it is mentioned ſeveral times before in this Book) is uſed as a Type to repreſent a Deſolation by: and why <hi>St. John,</hi> having had ſo many
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38410:73"/>mighty Deſolations repreſented to him both before and after this, was never called into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> to ſee any of them. Since therefore the Doctor has not thought fit to clear this Point, which yet is neceſſary for the explicating and confirming this Hypotheſis, I can ſee no reaſon it ſhould be admitted. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have had mention of this <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> before, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. and alſo of her <hi>flying into the Wilderneſs.</hi> If any Man thinks that, and this, two different <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> he ought to prove it: for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a better Reaſon cannot be given nor deſired, why <hi>St. John</hi> was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> to ſee the <hi>Woman,</hi> than becauſe the <hi>Woman</hi> was fled thither.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon the Doctor's Hypotheſis no good Reaſon can be given why <hi>St. John</hi> at the ſight of this Woman, is ſaid at v. 6. to have wondered with ſuch great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Did he wonder at her Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or at her Idolatry, or at her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Saints? Nothing of theſe was in thoſe days any ſtrange thing at all. And St. <hi>John</hi> had ſeen ſo many
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38410:73"/>ſtrange things before, without any ſuch expreſſion of his admiration, that we cannot think but that there is ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſon, why St. <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to have bin ſtricken with ſuch wonder and aſtoniſhment at this Woman only in the Viſion we are treating of. The plain reaſon therefore is this (which, though it agrees exactly with our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as ſhall hereafter be declared more at large, yet not at all with that which the Doctor gives us) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>St. John</hi> wondred with great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee that Woman, whom before at <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. he <hi>had ſeen in Heaven cloathed with the Sun,</hi> and <hi>the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars,</hi> perſecuted by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and deſpiſing all worldly things, and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto blood for the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> to ſee this Woman, I ſay now that ſhe is come into the Wilderneſs, glittering in ſuch ſecular Pomp, arraied in Purple, bedecked with Jewels, <hi>ſitting upon a Scarlet-coloured Beaſt, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads and ten Horns,</hi> (the Beaſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38410:74"/>that had perſecuted her
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Chap.</hi> xii. 3.</note> not long before) become a great Idolatreſs, <hi>making all the Kings of the Earth drunken with the Wine of her Fornication, and her ſelf with the blood of Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi> And this ſo great, and ſo ſuppriſing an alteration of this Woman, as it was the true, ſo it was a worthy reaſon of the Prophets admiration and aſtoniſhment. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we ſuppoſe with the Doctor, that the <hi>Woman</hi> here ſpoken of is <hi>old Heathen Rome,</hi> there can no good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be given, why, though ſhe were confeſſedly a great Idolatreſs, yet ſhould here be repreſented as having a golden Cup in her hands full of Abominations, and filthines of her Fornication, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (as is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) the <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth have bin made drunken.</hi> For by this it ſhould ſeem, that old Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> was a great promoter of her own Idolatry amongſt other Nations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is manifeſt in the Hiſtories of thoſe times, that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> did rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38410:74"/>her Idol-Worſhip from other Nations, than impoſe her own upon them, even on thoſe ſhe conquered. For it hath been obſerved of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Romans,</hi> that at their laying Seige to any City, they made their firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by ſolemn invocation of its tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar God's, that having theſe propitious to them, they might obtain the eaſier Victory. Neither was it ever heard, that ancient <hi>Rome</hi> intoxicated any other Nation with her Cup, ſhe having <hi>found,</hi> not <hi>made</hi> them Idol-Worſhippers.</p>
               <p>And of this we have a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Jewiſh People; who being at that time the only People that were not Idolaters, the Romans having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered them, did never yet impoſe their Superſtitions on them, but permitted them the free and quiet exerciſe of their own Religion. And though they went about, in meer deſpite to Chriſtianity, to make the Chriſtians ſacrifice to their Idols; yet this was only an Attempt, and uneffected. So that I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may truly be affirmed of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38410:75"/>under Heaven, that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> has made them drunken with her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. This therefore the Doctor ſhould have cleared alſo, if it had bin poſſible, and given us ſufficient convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it (and particularly that <hi>Rome</hi> did ſo in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, whom he makes the Beaſt ſhe ſits upon) or elſe his Expoſition cannot ſtand, though <hi>Rome</hi> were otherwiſe never ſo addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Idolatry? But,</p>
               <p n="4">4. It doth not well appear from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Scripture, and the uſe of this word <hi>[Whore]</hi> in Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, how it can be applied, (as here it is, according to this Expoſition) to old <hi>Heathen Rome.</hi> For ſhe is called at <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>the great Whore that ſitteth upon many Waters.</hi> But now in Scripture Prophecy, no <hi>City,</hi> that I can find i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But of no other People, no not of <hi>Babylon</hi> herſelf, the great Metropolis of Idolatry, we do not find the like expreſſions, at leaſt we may be confident that it is no uſual thing, if it be any where to be found in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe God's People are in Covenant with him, and there has a kind of Conjugal Obligation paſt between them: which when his People break by ſerving other God's, they act the part of an Adultereſs, who violates the Faith ſhe plighted to her Husband. And this alſo is the reaſon which the Prophets themſelves have given us of this compellation; as you may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 8. and again <hi>Chap.</hi> xxiii. 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 1. &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> iii. 20. And in many other places of holy Scripture. Since then old Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin in Covenant with God, nor reckon'd as his peculiar People, either the holy Spirit of Prophecy is very far departed from his uſual phraſe, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Heathen Rome</hi> a <hi>Whore,</hi> or elſe the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38410:76"/>Doctor is very much miſtaken in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of this name to Heathen <hi>Rome.</hi> And I cannot but obſerve here alſo, that he quite forgets his uſual method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture-difficulties, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all he ſaies for granted, and not ſo much as offering to clear this point by any ſingle inſtance how this word is uſed otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Doctor is alike wanting to his Cauſe, in the Expoſition of the word <hi>King,</hi> and that of <hi>Beaſt:</hi> which he ought to ſhew us from like Scripture-inſtances, to be applicable to ſingle Kings apart from other of the ſame line and order. But this he could not do, for I have prov'd already from all the inſtances that we have in Scripture, that in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of prophetick Viſions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe words is ſo uſed. Only a <hi>King</hi> when he is typified by a <hi>ſingle Horn,</hi> muſt ſignifie a <hi>ſingle King,</hi> as we have before explain'd it. But beſides that this is not applicable to our preſent caſe, which ſpeaketh not of any ſingle Horn or King, but of ſeven Kings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38410:76"/>it had become the Doctor's learning to have ſhewn us, where-ever any ſingle King is typified by a Beaſt. But inſtead of this

But to cite a paſſage of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Satyr, to ſhew the meaning of a Prophetick Type, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, is all one as if a Man ſhould go about to expound thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>I am come to ſend Fire on the Earth,</hi> of the <hi>natural Element of Fire;</hi> becauſe it is ſo uſed in <hi>Ariſtotle's Phyſics.</hi> And beſides we may obſerve how well the Doctor has improv'd that Satyr of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38410:77"/>
                  <hi>Julian;</hi> for whereas <hi>Julian</hi> has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Domitian</hi> only as a bloody Beaſt, the Doctor has ſo ordered the matter, that he has given him ten Horns too, and if he had quoted another Satyr for the meaning of the Horns, he would have made <hi>Domitian</hi> ſuch a Monſter as no Satyriſt ever dream't of. But,</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Doctor has given us no good account, why his eight Emperors are typified by no more then ſeven Heads or Kings. Of this he ſeems to give us this reaſon in his Paraphraſe upon <hi>ver.</hi> 11. The Beaſt (ſaies the Angel there) <hi>which was, and is not, he is the eighth King, and is of the ſeven:</hi> that is, according to the Doctor's Paraphraſe, <hi>Domitian,</hi> who was Emperor, and is not Emperor, he is the eighth, and is the Son of one of the ſeven, to wit, of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> But then he ſhould have ſhewn, 1ſt, How, theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, can ſignifie, <hi>He is the Son of one of the ſeven.</hi> And, 2dly. Why (upon ſuppoſal of this Expoſition to be valid) his eight Emperors are not rather typified by ſix, then by ſeven
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38410:77"/>Heads. For if <hi>Domitian</hi> be one of the ſeven Heads, becauſe he was the Son of one of them: then both <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> might have bin included in but ſix Heads, becauſe they were both of them the Sons of the ſixth Emperor, <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> Or if the reaſon, as the Doctor ſeems to intimate alſo, why theſe eight Emperors are repreſented in the Viſion by but ſeven Heads or Kings, be, becauſe <hi>Domitian</hi> had reigned for his Father, before he reigned for himſelf: this ſeems to be a Reaſon, why they ſhould rather have bin repreſented by nine, or ten, than by ſeven Heads or Kings.</p>
               <p>For by this means are made two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reigns of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s (one before <hi>Domitian</hi>'s former Reign, as the Doctor calls it, and the other after;) and two more of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s, one for his Father, and the other for himſelf. And this is the more obſervable, becauſe the Doctor drives on this Notion ſo far, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thoſe words of <hi>Ireneus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:38410:78"/>
                  <hi>Domitian's</hi> Reign, while he reigned for his Father: Whereby either the Reigns of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; or we muſt make two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reigns of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s, and two other of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s. And thus we have no good reaſon given us either way why theſe eight Emperors are typified by but ſeven Heads or Kings. But,</p>
               <p n="7">7. Why are theſe eight Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, ſingled out from among their fellows, that were both before and after them? And why muſt we begin to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon them from <hi>Claudius,</hi> or end them with <hi>Domitian?</hi> Or what need was there to have repreſented theſe eight Emperors in the Viſion, when there is nothing purpoſely ſaid of any of them, but <hi>Domitian</hi> only? Now the reaſon of this from our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> is very clear: for ſo the ſeven Heads or Kings, upon the Roman Beaſt or Empire, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſeven ſeveral ſorts of ſupream Governments, <hi>five</hi> whereof <hi>were faln</hi> in <hi>St. John's</hi> time, &amp;c. will ſerve for a moſt incomparable and exact diſtinction of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38410:78"/>the Roman Kingdom from all other Kingdoms in the World. And why is any Beaſt particularly deſcribed, as this is here ſaid to have had ſeven Heads and ten Horns, but to diſtinguiſh it from other Beaſts? and further, ſince, (as hath bin ſhewed) none of theſe Heads is concerned in this Prophecy, but the laſt: what can the mention of the ſix others ſignifie, but only to define this Beaſt, and to diſtinguiſh him from other Kingdoms? But nothing of this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Doctor's Expoſition. Only he ſeems to give this reaſon in his Paraphraſe, why we ſhould begin to reckon the eight Kings from <hi>Claudius,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt of the Roman Emperors that had to do with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But had <hi>Tiberius</hi> then nothing to do with Chriſtians, in whoſe Reign our Saviour Chriſt himſelf was put to Death? Or was <hi>Domitian</hi> the laſt Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperor that had to do with Chriſtians? But of this enough.</p>
               <p>And now although the Doctor ſeems to me to have done the part of a very
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38410:79"/>indifferent Expoſitor hitherto; yet, if there were no other Reaſon to reject his Expoſition, but for the many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances he has heaped together in his Expoſition of the Myſtery of the ten Horns, which now come to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it could not poſſibly be admitted.</p>
               <p>For, 1. He expounds theſe ten Horns of the Roman Empire, to be ten Kings of ten Barbarous Nations, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon the Roman Empire. But it is manifeſt from all the Prophetick interpretations of holy Scripture, where this type is uſed, that it never ſignifies any neighbouring Kingdom, but when a Beaſt or Kingdom is repreſented with Horns, they alwayes ſignifie that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be divided into ſo many ſmaller Kingdoms as the Beaſt had Horns. And all Men muſt needs acknowledge the truth of this aſſertion, who underſtand any thing of the <hi>Idiom</hi> of Prophetick Language.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid of theſe ten Horns at <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>That they are ten Kings, which have receiv'd no Kingdom as yet, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38410:79"/>power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt.</hi> The plain meaning of which Words is this: That although the Roman Empire be not yet divided into theſe ten Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms, yet when the Beaſt appears, theſe Horns ſhall riſe together with him. And ſince by this Beaſt the Doctor underſtands <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> his Expoſition cannot poſſibly be true, unleſs the Roman Empire came to be divided into theſe ten Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms in <hi>Domitian's</hi> time. But becauſe he was not able to give us any proof or likelihood of this, ſee how he wreſts the meaning of that verſe next before quoted, to force it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Hypotheſis. <hi>The ten Horns are ten Kings, which have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beaſt;</hi> that is, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, <hi>They have receiv'd no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as yet within the Roman Empire, but comply for a ſhort time with the Roman Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Angel tells us, That <hi>theſe ten Horns receive Power as Kings one hour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38410:80"/>with the Beaſt.</hi> Which words the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor thus expounds, <hi>They comply,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for a ſhort time with the Roman power.</hi> He had told us all along before, that this Beaſt was <hi>Domitian:</hi> But now he calls it the <hi>Roman Power.</hi> And <hi>to receive Power as Kings,</hi> he interprets to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>complying with the Roman Power.</hi> So that it ſeems, <hi>to comply with the Roman Power, is to receive Power as Kings.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only theſe ten Horns here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, but alſo all the Subjects of the Roman Empire, and all Nations that were conquered by them, may equally be ſaid <hi>to have received Power as Kings,</hi> by their complying with the Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:38410:80"/>ten Horns, did give their Strength and Power, and Kingdom to <hi>Domitian.</hi> Of any Strength, or Power, or Kingdom that they gave him, he mentions not a word, but only tells us, That they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Chriſtians in their Territories, as the Emperor did. So that to <hi>Perſecute Chriſtians</hi> as the Emperor did, <hi>was to give their Power, and Strength, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to him. And now any one would expect, that the Doctor having taken ſo vaſt a latitude of interpreting theſe Words, had bin able to make it out exceeding manifeſtly, That theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> did perſecute Chriſtians, as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi> did. But if any Man will take the pains to conſult his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon this <hi>Chapter,</hi> he ſhall find him hunting over all the Hiſtories of thoſe times, but yet not able to produce any the leaſt proof or evidence of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So he concludes at laſt, That there had not bin any authoritative Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians in thoſe Barbarous Kingdoms, till about the eighteenth year of the Reign of <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> that is,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:38410:81"/>about 200 years after <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, <hi>but,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>tis like there was in</hi> Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian<hi>'s Reign;</hi> although for want of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories recording the particular paſſages of thoſe times, he complains he could not make it evident. But if he could, what would it ſignifie? For he ſhould have proved that they perſecuted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not in <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Reign, but in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s, whom he makes the Beaſt, to whom theſe <hi>ten Kings ſhould give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctor gives us a lame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what is ſaid concerning theſe ten Horns, at <hi>ver.</hi> 17. That <hi>God had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> in their Hearts to fulfil his Will, and to agree and give their Kingdom to the Beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> For inſtead of proving this Argument of theirs to give their Kingdom to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See the Doctor's Annot. upon that place.</note> he only proves the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in deſtroying the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the immediate hand of God in it But of <hi>Alaricus</hi>'s (by whoſe Arms the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:38410:81"/>City of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſpoiled) or of the other nine Horns agreeing to give their Kingdom to <hi>Domitian</hi> (which only the verſe he comments on, doth mention) he is utterly ſilent. And indeed he might well be ſo; For <hi>Alaricus,</hi> nor any other King of his time, was hardly born within two hundred and fifty years after <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We ſhall diſmiſs the Doctor's Expoſition, with this one Obſervation more, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas it is ſaid of theſe <hi>ten Horns</hi> at ver. 16. That <hi>they ſhould hate the Whore, and make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> &amp;c. The Doctor tells us this was done when the Barbarous Nations ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rome.</hi> But we muſt obſerve that <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, if ever, was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian City, and governed by a Chriſtian Emperor. So that, what he ſhould have proved to have bin don to Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he makes the Whore, (and that by right in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time too; for <hi>Rome</hi> is concerned no further in this Viſion, than as ſitting upon the Beaſt,) he proves to have bin done more than
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:38410:82"/>three hundred years after, when as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry had bin deſtroyed in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhe was now become a Chriſtian City. But he ſeems to give ſome Reaſon of this Expoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were yet remaining ſeveral Monuments of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry; that even the Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were very much addicted to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Luſts, and that there were many Heathens in her at that time, whom chiefly that Calamity befel. But ſo there were alſo many Monuments of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in <hi>Heathen Rome,</hi> and multitudes of Saints and pious Chriſtians. So that either <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> was no Whore, who had ſo many excellent Chriſtians; or elſe <hi>Rome Chriſtian</hi> was no Whore, though poſſibly ſhe had many Heathens in her. And let the Reader take his choice; though ſtill we ſhould grant, that <hi>Chriſtian Rome</hi> when ſhe was thus infeſted by the barbarous Nations, was the <hi>Whore</hi> here ſpoken of: yet were the Miſeries which they brought upon her, too light for the accompliſhment of the Deſolations of this Prophecy. For it is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38410:82"/>here ſaid of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> that <hi>they ſhould hate the Whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and ſhould eat her fleſh, and burn her with Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which deſtruction of this great City <hi>Babylon</hi> the Spirit deſcants both more plainly, and more fully, <hi>Chap.</hi> xviii. 8. telling us, That <hi>her Plagues ſhall come in one day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire,</hi> &amp;c. And again at <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The fruits that thy Soul luſted after, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou ſhalt find them no more at all.</hi> With many other expreſſions to like purpoſe, which cannot otherwiſe be interpreted, but of the utter ruin and deſtruction of that City, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot have bin accompliſhed in that curſory pillage of it by <hi>Alaricus,</hi> who burnt ſome part indeed, and made ſome havock of the reſt, but leſt it in a very little time, and did no great, nor laſting miſchief to it.</p>
               <p>And thus much of that Expoſition,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:38410:83"/>which interprets <hi>the ſeven Kings</hi> of ſo many <hi>ſingle Kings,</hi> and makes the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be <hi>Domitian,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> to be <hi>Heathen</hi> Rome.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO conclude. I ſuppoſe that it will not be denied by any, but that by the ſeven Heads or Kings are meant, either ſeven ſingle Kings, with <hi>H. Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> or an uncertain number of them, with <hi>Bellarmin;</hi> or laſtly, ſeven ſeveral Orders and ſucceſſions of ſupream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, according as hath bin before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. Since therefore they cannot be underſtood either of ſeven ſingle Kings or of an uncertain number of them: they muſt be interpreted of ſeven ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38410:83"/>Orders or Succeſſions of Supream Governors, which can be no other, than thoſe already named, <hi>viz. Kings, Conſuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, Dictators, Heathen Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Popes.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors,</hi> being that other King, not come in <hi>St. John</hi>'s time, (neither any Head of the Blaſphemous Beaſt) who when he came, was to continue but a ſhort time, in reſpect either of the preceding, or ſucceeding King, that is, either of the Heathen Emperors that went before them, or the Popes that followed them.</p>
               <p>And thus we have clearly ſhewn, that all the Marks and Characters of the Beaſt, which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Woman ſitting on, (according as the Angel has explained them) are moſt truly, genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inely, properly, and reaſonably, without any the leaſt conſtraint or violence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the <hi>Roman Biſhops,</hi> from that time wherein the ſeventh King, the Roman Chriſtian Emperors, came to be deſtroyed, and the Empire to be divided into ten Horns or ſmaller Kingdoms.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38410:84"/>It muſt therefore follow of neceſſity, that the Popes are that Beaſt under whoſe conduct, thoſe Horns were <hi>to make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb to overcome them:</hi> and that the Woman, or City of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſitting upon the Beaſt under this ſeventh Head or King, is that <hi>great Whore</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>arraied in Purple, and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let colour, and decked with Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone, and Pearls, having a Golden Cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthineſs of her Fornication. And upon her Forehead a Name written,</hi> MYSTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. <hi>And whom he ſaw alſo drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, I hope, it will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me, that I ſhould prove by any other Arguments not contained in this Prophecy, That the Kings have, by the procurement and inſtigation of the Popes, from time to time, made War
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38410:84"/>againſt the Lamb, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> or that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Popes (ſince they came to be the laſt Head or King of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) hath bin the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fornication or Idolatry, making the Inhabitants of the Earth <hi>drunk with the golden Cup</hi> of her abominable Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and her ſelf with <hi>the Blood of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> that is, of ſuch as for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel's ſake have dar'd at any time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and cenſure her Impieties. No; this was none of my deſign, but it has bin abundantly perform'd already by all thoſe famous Writers, who from the firſt appearance of the Romiſh Superſtitions, have oppoſed themſelves againſt them. And it is manifeſt to all the World how little favour they have had from <hi>Rome,</hi> who have at any time bin ſo hardy as to cenſure her Religion, and condemn it as Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>My buſineſs therefore was only this; To ſearch out who this <hi>Woman</hi> was, and who the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that carrieth her, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38410:85"/>as the Angel has deſcrib'd them in his Interpretation of the Viſion, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing St. <hi>John</hi> at ver. 7. that he would tell him <hi>the Myſtery of the Woman, and of the Beaſt that carrieth her, which hath the ſeven Heads and ten Horns.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I ſuppoſe, is meant, that he would give ſuch a deſcription of them, as ſhould ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> in the World. So that what-ever <hi>Woman,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Beast</hi> can be proved to have all thoſe Marks and Characters appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, whereby the Angel here deſcribes the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> we ſpeak of, muſt needs be that <hi>Woman</hi> and that <hi>Beaſt</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw in ſuch unhappy and amazing circumſtances as were repreſented to him in the Viſion.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Angel tells us at ver. 14. concerning the ten Horns, That they ſhould <hi>make War with the Lamb, and that the Lamb ſhould overcome them;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>That they ſhould hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c.</hi> If we have plainly ſhewed from all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38410:85"/>whereby the Angel has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed theſe Horns, that ſuch and ſuch Kings and Kingdoms are deſigned by them; it muſt follow of neceſſity, upon ſuppoſition of the truth of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, That ſuch and ſuch Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhould <hi>make War with the Lamb, and that the Lamb ſhould overcome them; and that they ſhould hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if any Man pretending to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy, ſhould foretel, That the next Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who ſhall be called by the name of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and ſhall have his Reſidence at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> ſhall be a Chriſtian: if hereafter it ſhall be evidently demonſtrated, that ſuch an Emperour is really and truly that next Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that is called by the name of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and that he has his Reſidence at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> either this Prophecy muſt be falſe, or elſe that Emperour muſt be a Chriſtian. So, in our preſent caſe, The Angel tells us that theſe ten Kings, whom he had before deſcribed, <hi>ſhall make War with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38410:86"/>the Lamb, &amp;c.</hi> If therefore any Man can plainly ſhew that all the Marks and Characters whereby the Angel has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined them, do really and truly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſuch and ſuch Kings; it muſt likewiſe follow of neceſſity either that the Prophecy muſt be falſe, or that theſe Kings, to whom theſe Marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters do belong, ſhall war againſt the Lamb.</p>
               <p>And this was all I intended to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, namely, Who this <hi>Woman,</hi> this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and theſe <hi>Horns</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould be, of whom ſuch horrid things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Angel, and repreſented in the Viſion to <hi>St. John.</hi> And if any Man can give a better account of them, no doubt he will perform an acceptable piece of ſervice to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But though it be not my buſineſs to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and conſequently the Oppoſers of it, <hi>Saints</hi> (in the ſence of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) by any Arguments not contain'd in the Prophecy it ſelf; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to make the proof of it more
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38410:86"/>eaſie, (ſo far as is requiſit to the verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Prophecy) and to put the matter almoſt out of queſtion, I ſhall add an Obſervation, which, it may be, has not bin ſo generally taken notice of; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Name</hi> of her Idolatry is not ſaid to have bin written in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>Heart,</hi> where none but God can ſee it, but in her <hi>Forehead,</hi> viſible and conſpicuous to the Eye of Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have nothing more to prove againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of this Prophecy, but that her outward act of Worſhip is Idolatrous. Wherefore we only ſay, (and I think they cannot eaſily deny it) that they bow, they kiſs, they burn Incenſe, they kneel before their Images, and in that poſture of addreſs, they ſay their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with their Eyes upon their Images, which to the Eye of the Beholder looks as if they ſaid their Prayers to them. Wherefore as to the outward act, they worſhip them by theſe addreſſes. Nay, they confeſs they do ſo; nay, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it, they enact it as a Law, they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38410:87"/>curſe and perſecute the oppoſers of this Worſhip.</p>
               <p>But they add, They worſhip them with a <hi>relative Worſhip,</hi> that is, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the worſhip of their <hi>Images</hi> to their <hi>Prototypes.</hi> But whether they do this or no, God only knows. Yet ſtill this Name is written in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> That they are <hi>Idolaters.</hi> They pray to Saints, to Angels, and eſpecially to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as frequently, as devoutly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, with the ſame poſtures of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and with like forms of Prayer, as they do to God. And here they ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they worſhip them with a <hi>relative Worſhip,</hi> not as <hi>Gods,</hi> but as the <hi>Friends of God.</hi> And we anſwer them again in like manner as before, that ſtill this name is written in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> That they are <hi>Idolaters.</hi> So that for all their <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Worſhip,</hi> and their good Intention, this Prophecy of a <hi>Name written in the Woman's Forehead, <hi>(Myſtery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth)</hi>
                  </hi> may be verified in them. For certainly in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38410:87"/>they are as great Idolaters, and promoters of it, as was ever <hi>Babylon</hi> her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now therefore I ſhall draw up my <hi>Arguments</hi> from what I have, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſufficiently demonſtrated, in this Form that here followeth:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Woman</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw in this Viſion, ſitting upon the <hi>Beast,</hi> was to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of Spiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Idolatry, and <hi>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the City of <hi>Rome</hi> having the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under the Government of her Biſhops, from ſuch time as that Empire came to be divided into ten Kingdoms, is the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw in this Viſion ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from that time forward was to be the <hi>Mother</hi> of Spiritual Fornication, or Idolatry, <hi>and drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:38410:88"/>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Beaſt</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting on is the ſeventh and laſt Head of the Blaſphemous Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>But the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> from ſuch time as that Empire came to be divided into ten Kingdoms, are the ſeventh and laſt Head of the Blaſphemous Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> from that time forward, are the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitting on.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,</p>
               <p>The <hi>ten Horns</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw upon this <hi>Beaſt, were to make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb to overcome them, and they afterwards to hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe ten Kings (with their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors) who have bin already ſhewn to have ſhared the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them about the Year 456, are the <hi>ten Horns</hi> which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw upon this <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:38410:88"/>
               <p>Therefore thoſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> (with their Succeſſors) <hi>were to make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb to overcome them, and they afterwards to hate the Whore, and make her deſolate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Angel gives us of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon which <hi>St. John</hi> ſaw the <hi>Whore ſitting,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Theſe Waters</hi> (ſaith the Angel, ver. 15.) <hi>are Peoples, and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and Nations, and Tongues;</hi> But the meaning of this is both very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and as applicable to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Headſhip and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of her Biſhops, as at any other time. For hereby is only ſignified, that ſhe ſhould then enjoy a kind of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> or Univerſal Headſhip, not over any one People, Multitude, Tongue, or Nation, but over very many of them,</p>
               <p>Only here it may not be amiſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Scheme and Conſtitution of the Viſion. For the Roman Empire is here repreſented to <hi>St. John</hi> by a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſituate upon ſeven Heads or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, (as upon an Iſland) with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38410:89"/>ſubject to her Juriſdiction, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd like <hi>Waters</hi> round about her. By which the two conſtitutive parts of the Roman World, like thoſe of this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, are <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water:</hi> the Woman dwelling on the one, and her ſubjects on the other. Which Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will be of great uſe to us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in the explicating of the xiith and xiiith Chapters, where I muſt remind the Reader of it.</p>
               <p>And now as I have very ſtudiouſly inquired into the meaning of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: So I hope it will not give offence to any Man, that I have thus plainly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the World, what hath bin the reſult of my enquiry.

                  </gap> too irreconcilable already; but of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Glory of God, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men's Souls. For I confeſsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> have taken but little pleaſure in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38410:89"/>ſave only that of finding out the Truth, (as I ſuppoſe) and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting it to others.</p>
               <p>And yet, if after all my Labour, it ſhall be evidently proved that I have erred in the main of my Deſign, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s or <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi>'s Expoſition clearly vindicated, or ſome other offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that might ſerve <hi>Rome</hi>'s turn as well, and that confirmed and demonſtrated from the undoubted Characters of the Angel's Interpretation and the genuine ſignification of the Prophetick Types which are made uſe of in the Viſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are conſtantly, or moſt uſually obſerv'd to ſignifie in other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and eſpecially in Prophetick Viſions and Interpretations like this that we are ſpeaking of: I ſhould be ſo far from repining at my miſadventure, or from envying that Man the glory of his great Performance, that I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther further it with all my might, and from my very heart rejoice in that ſo welcome News, and acceptable piece of ſervice to the Church of God.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:38410:90"/>
               <p>And yet, notwithſtanding that we have proved the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> from about the Year 456, to be the laſt of the ſeven Heads or Kings of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Roman Empire, and, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to be the Antichriſtian Beaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this <hi>Viſion;</hi> as alſo thoſe ten Kings, with their Succeſſors, who at that time ſhared the Roman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and became one Kingdom (as it were) again, under the Headſhip and Supremacy of the Popes, to be the Kings that <hi>were to make War with the Lamb;</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from that ſame time to be the <hi>Woman</hi> here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as the moſt abominable City in the World for her Idolatry, and her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of the Saints: We muſt not therefore raſhly hence conclude, that there was never any Chriſtian Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from that time forward, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King in all the Roman Empire, or that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf hath bin alike polluted with Idolatry all along, and no Salvation to be had in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:38410:90"/>
               <p>No, it is enough for the fulfilling of this Prophecy (and we need not make it worſe) that her Impieties arrived to the height they now are at, and have bin at theſe many years, inſenſibly and by ſlow degrees; and that it has bin the main deſign of thoſe ten Kings, with their Succeſſors, to advance the Roman Biſhops, together with their Intereſts and Idolatries, and to aſſiſt them with their power and ſtrength againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtood in oppoſition to them. For as a wicked perſon may have ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable qualities, which ſometimes may exert themſelves in Chriſtian works, and yet the perſon be exceeding vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to his habitual courſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: ſo doubtleſs there has bin much good in <hi>Rome,</hi> before ſhe made her wound incurable; and many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of eminent Chriſtians (for ought I know) among her Biſhops, and among thoſe Kings and their Succeſſors that confederated with them. According as we may obſerve in thoſe three Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which we find given to them <hi>Rev.</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:38410:91"/>xiv. The firſt was only, That they ſhould <hi>fear God, and worſhip him, &amp;c.</hi> Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to keep themſelves from Idols, and to worſhip God only, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. The next was a denunciation of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in not only committing, but propagating her Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. But the laſt was more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere yet, at ver. 9. <hi>That if any man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Beaſt, and his Image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,</hi> (a myſtical periphraſis of <hi>adhering to him) the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is powred out without mixture, into the Cup of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, &amp;c.</hi> By which it ſeems, that it has not bin always alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to communicate with <hi>Rome,</hi> and that ſhe did not <hi>fall</hi> but by degrees: but yet at laſt, that it ſhould be ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as to be inconſiſtent with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And whether that time be not long ſince come, (as we may fear it is) I leave the Reader to determin.</p>
               <p>And now from all that hath bin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:38410:91"/>ſaid, it is manifeſt, That <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> was to be expected ſoon after the deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; for the other King, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors) who was to interpoſe between the Heathen Emperors, and the ſeventh Head, (the Antichriſtian King) was to continue but a little while. So that upon the diſſolution of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, and the diviſion of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Kingdoms, the <hi>Antichriſtian Beaſt</hi> ſhould preſently aſcend the Imperial Throne, and ſhew himſelf the next Head of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>And hence we ſee the reaſon of that Tradition of the Primitive Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Roman Empire was the thing which hindred the revealing of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> For it was neceſſary that the Head which then reigned, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King of ſhort continuance, (who is not typified by any Head, becauſe he was not blaſphemous) ſhould be firſt deſtroyed, before the next (that is, the <hi>Antichriſtian Beast</hi>) could poſſibly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:38410:92"/>him. Hence it appears alſo, That the <hi>Seat</hi> of Antichriſt was to be the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And laſtly, That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that he was to teach, was to commit <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and that the <hi>War</hi> he was to make, ſhould be <hi>to perſecute the Saints.</hi> Which will be further yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the explication of the xiith and xiiith Chapters, which now come to be conſidered.</p>

               <p>FRom that Prophecy which we have <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii, the only Viſion of this myſterious Book, ſo punctually and ſo purpoſely expounded by an Angel; as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:38410:93"/>if it were deſigned for a Key to all the other Viſions; We proceed now to the xiith and xiiith Chapters, where we find this <hi>Woman,</hi> and this <hi>ſeven-headed</hi> and <hi>ten-horned Beaſt</hi> again, though in a little different guiſe from that we have already ſeen them in. But before I undertake the Expoſition of theſe Chapters, I muſt here give the Reader notice, that I muſt take for granted what I have already proved from the Angel's words, to be the meaning of the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> of this ſeven-headed Beaſt, and of the <hi>Woman</hi> that was ſitting upon him. If therefore what I have already proved be not done effectually, what-ever I ſhall build upon it, muſt needs fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it. But if that ground work and Foundation have any firmneſs or ſolidity in it ſelf, I doubt not upon that <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> to ſhew theſe other Viſions not only ſo exactly, but ſo wonderfully anſwered by the events of things, that the Explication of them ſhall not ſeem to borrow ſtrength from its Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather to confirm and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:38410:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>In order therefore to the explication of the xiith and xiiith Chapters, let it be remembred, that in the xviith we had mention of <hi>eight Kings; five</hi> whereof were <hi>faln;</hi> and the other <hi>two</hi> to come. <hi>Seven</hi> of them (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſix firſt, and the laſt) were typified by the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> of the Blaſphemous Beaſt: but the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> not.</p>
               <p>As for the five that were faln, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were faln, this Prophecy concerns it ſelf no further with them. But of the other three we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Hiſtory and deſcription in the Chapters we are now upon: as alſo of the ſtate and condition of the Woman under every one of them.</p>
               <p>Of the King that reigned in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, and of the ſtate of the Woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reign, we have an account in the xii Chapter from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>ver.</hi> 12. From thence to the end of that Chapter is ſet forth to us the ſtate of the Woman, under the other King of ſhort continuance, who was to be no Head of the Blaſphemous Beaſt, and is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:38410:94"/>there typified by <hi>two wings of a great Eagle.</hi> From hence to the end of the xiiith Chapter (which anſwers to the xviith) is repreſented the ſtate of the Woman under the eighth King, at what time the ten Horns came to be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to <hi>receive Power as Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under theſe three Kings this Woman was diverſly treated. By the firſt ſhe was perſecuted, by the ſecond indulged and ſupported; by the third careſs'd and pamper'd to the greateſt height of Pomp and Pride, of Wantonneſs and Luxury. Accordingly we muſt expect that ſhe ſhould demean her ſelf diverſly under each of them. Under the firſt, while ſhe was perſecuted by the ſecular Power, ſhe continued pure and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, both in Life and Doctrine; I mean <hi>comparatively pure,</hi> in reference to her ſubſequent demeanour under the two Kings that followed. Under the ſecond, while ſhe was indulged and ſupported by the ſecular Power, ſhe began to be leſs circumſpect in her converſation, to degenerate to Covetouſneſs and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38410:94"/>in Manners, and Superſtition in Worſhip. Notwithſtanding being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much exerciſed by the fraud and malice of Hereticks, ſhe perſiſted Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the Faith. Under the third, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten the ſecular Power into her own hands (at leaſt as far as might ſerve her own purpoſe) ſhe waxed wanton, and played the Harlot, intoxicating the Nations with her Fornications, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oting in the Blood of her oppoſers.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt King therefore ſhe is repreſented in the <hi>ſtarry Heaven,</hi> in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of her <hi>Heavenly Purity.</hi> Under the ſecond ſhe is repreſented upon <hi>Eagles Wints,</hi> in a much lower Sphere and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion than before, and as it were flying down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth,</hi> in ſign of her <hi>declenſion</hi> and degeneracy. Under the third, ſhe is repreſented ſitting upon a <hi>ten-horned blaſpemous Beaſt,</hi> that aroſe out of the Abyſs, in token of her utter <hi>depravation</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> All which will be much more clear by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſideration of the Prophecy it ſelf; and therefore I ſhall begin with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38410:95"/>that part of it, which concerns the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under the Reign of the firſt of the three Kings, (<hi>viz.</hi> the King that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>St. John</hi>'s time) while ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in her ſtate of <hi>heavenly purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtate of hers is ſet forth by the Prophet in theſe words:</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven, a Woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet; and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars:</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>And there appeared another wonder in Heaven, And behold a great red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his Heads.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>And his Tail drew the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth: and the Dragon ſtood before the Woman which was ready to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And ſhe brought forth a Man-Child,

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And the Woman fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus far is a deſcription of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>Heavenly purity</hi> in her primitive State.</p>
               <p>Now I take it to be one of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things that can be demonſtrated in any Propheſie, that by the <hi>Woman</hi> here, is meant the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For of this Woman it is ſaid, at <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that ſhe <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs;</hi> the manner of her flight being deſcribed at ver. 14. And in the Wilderneſs ſhe was ſeen by <hi>St. John ſitting upon a Scarlet-coloured Beast,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 3. This Woman therefore is the ſame with her whom St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the Wilderneſs; only here ſhe is deſcribed in all the Glories of her primitive purity: whereas ſhe is there ſet forth in all the ſcandalous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of her ſecular pomp, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly domination. But now in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this <hi>Woman</hi> is interpreted by the Angel to be <hi>that great City,</hi> which we
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:38410:96"/>have before proved, and which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, even by the Romaniſts themſelves, confeſt to be the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> But they would have it to be underſtood of <hi>Heathen Rome;</hi> which cannot be, not only for the reaſons heretofore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Expoſition of the xviith Chapter, but becauſe it were the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing in the World to underſtand theſe things of <hi>Heathen Rome,</hi> which are here ſpoken of this <hi>Woman</hi> before her flying into the Wilderneſs. For when, I pray, was <hi>Heathen Rome cloathed with the Sun, the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars?</hi> When was <hi>Heathen Rome</hi> in <hi>Travail,</hi> perſecuted by the <hi>Dragon</hi> (whom we ſhall prove anon to ſignifie <hi>Romes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors</hi>) and delivered of a <hi>Man-Child,</hi> who <hi>was caught up to the Throne of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore by <hi>the City</hi> of <hi>Rome, Rev.</hi> xvii. 18. cannot be meant the <hi>Heathen</hi> City, but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> City of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> at ſuch time when ſhe was generally <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38410:97"/>when the ſame People that were the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> were alſo the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which agrees exactly wich that account which we have given of this Woman in the Expoſition of the xviith Chapter, where it has bin proved that by the <hi>Woman</hi> is meant the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> ſuch as ſhe was to be under the Head-ſhip and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of her <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore we have ſeen this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Wilderneſs, ſitting upon the Roman Beaſt, that is, domineering over the Roman Empire, glittering with earthly Pomp, and intoxicating the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Wine of her Spiritual Fornication: ſo let us now behold her as ſhe is repreſented in her heavenly Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>cloathed with the Sun</hi> (by which is doubtleſs meant <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the light of the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi>) and having <hi>the Moon under her Feet:</hi> where by the <hi>Moon</hi> (as it ſtands oppoſed to the <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the bright day-light of the Goſpel) muſt be meant the <hi>dim light of Jewiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> and the <hi>darkneſs of Heatheniſh
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38410:97"/>Superſtitions.</hi> Which is a ſenſe that is very agreeable to Scripture-uſe, where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called <hi>Light,</hi> and all other <hi>Religions</hi> in oppoſition to it, are called <hi>night</hi> and <hi>darkneſs.</hi> Thus <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> xiii. 12. <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>St. John</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>The darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ineth.</hi> And this is ſo uſual a Metaphor in holy Scripture, that I cannot eaſily believe any other thing to be meant by <hi>the Sun,</hi> than <hi>the Light of the Goſpel;</hi> nor by <hi>the Moon,</hi> than the <hi>darkneſs of all other Diſpenſations.</hi> Certain I am that theſe Types as they are here uſed, will eaſily admit the ſenſe that I have given them; which to my purpoſe is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>And whereas this Woman is further repreſented with a <hi>Crown of twelve Stars,</hi> theſe Stars by their number <hi>twelve,</hi> have a manifeſt reference to <hi>the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> And they ſignifie the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the twelve Apoſtles, that is, with all the Churches of the Roman Empire that were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the twelve Apoſtles, and perſiſted
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:38410:98"/>in their Faith and Doctrine. And it is to be obſerved, that in her ſtate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly purity, ſhe is not repreſented <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> upon theſe twelve Stars (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the Roman Beaſt) in token of their ſubjection to her: but having them as a <hi>Crown upon her Head,</hi> that is, adorned with their fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as in the ſame moſt holy Faith, ſo in partaking of like ſufferings with her.</p>
               <p>And this Expoſition of the <hi>Woman</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is every was agreeable to the Angel's interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. ſo we ſhall find it no ſtrange thing in Scripture-prophecy to have the States of all ſubordinate Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties repreſented by that one of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial or Metropolitical City. And for this I might quote well near an hundred places out of the Prophets of the old. Teſtament. But the Reader may fully ſatisfie himſelf out of the xvi and xxiii Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Micha.</hi> But as for the <hi>twelve Stars,</hi> we ſhall yet give afurther account of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38410:98"/>them anon, from the Analogy of a like Type uſed in the deſcription of the <hi>Dragon.</hi> To proceed therefore.</p>
               <p>By this Woman's <hi>being with Child, crying, and travailing in birth, and being pained to be delivered, ver.</hi> 2. is plainly ſignified the ſorrows and afflictions ſhe endured, in gaining Proſelytes to the Faith of Chriſt. Her <hi>Children</hi> therefore are her <hi>Converts:</hi> her <hi>being with Child,</hi> denotes her <hi>Zeal</hi> in <hi>propagating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> to them: and her <hi>bringing forth,</hi> is her <hi>converting</hi> them. And though there ſeems to be mention made, but of <hi>one Child</hi> or Convert: yet we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as by <hi>one Dragon</hi> are meant <hi>all the Heathen Emperors,</hi> and as by <hi>one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an</hi> are meant <hi>all the members</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from time to time, ſo by <hi>one Child</hi> are typified <hi>all the Converts</hi> in thoſe Primitive times ſince firſt there was a Church eſtabliſhed in that City. And it is a very uſual thing in Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by <hi>one</hi> particular thing to typifie a <hi>whole ſort</hi> or order of the ſame kind of things.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:38410:99"/>
               <p>By <hi>the great red Dragon,</hi> ver. 3. is meant the <hi>Roman Heathen Emperors,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the ſhape of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> in token of their <hi>open enmity</hi> to the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without any colour or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe; as they were alſo <hi>great</hi> in Power, and <hi>red</hi> with their bloody uſe of it. And this is evident from that further deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this Dragon in the next words, where he is fet forth with <hi>ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Heads ſeven Crowns,</hi> but none as yet upon his <hi>Horns.</hi> For we have proved, that the ſeven Heads and ten Horns, are a type of the Roman Empire. And ſince the Horns are not crowned (as they are in the xiiith Chapter, when the time was come wherein they had <hi>received</hi> their <hi>Power as Kings</hi>) it cannot be repreſented here under its laſt Head the Popes; for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the laſt Head, the ten Horns were to <hi>receive Power as Kings,</hi> Rev. xvii. 12. And ſince the other five were faln before <hi>St. John</hi>'s time, it cannot be repreſented under any of them. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore, that it is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38410:99"/>under its ſixth Head, the <hi>Heathen Emperours;</hi> under whoſe Government the Roman Empire, with reſpect to Chriſtians, could not more fitly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to any thing than to <hi>a great red Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here let us obſerve by the way the reaſon why this ſeven-headed and ten-horned Beaſt is repreſented in the xiith Chapter, under the ſhape of a Dragon; and in the xiiith under the ſhape of a Leopard; but in the xviith under no ſhape at all. The reaſon is, becauſe the Beaſt was to partake of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers qualities, and accordingly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in divers ſhapes, according to the different qualities of his
<note n="*" place="margin">Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</note> Heads.</p>
               <p>When therefore he was to be expreſt under one Head only; as in the xiith Chapter under the ſixth Head; and in the xiiith under the ſeventh; he is particularly deſcribed in all his features. But in the xviith Chapter, where he is conſidered under all his Heads, on purpoſe to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38410:100"/>him from all other Beaſts or Kingdoms in the World, he is deſcribed in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only by ſuch Marks and Characters as he had in common under all his Heads, eſpecially the two laſt of them, which only are the ſubject of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, whereas it is ſaid of this Dragon at ver. 4. that <hi>his Tail drew the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that a third part of the Kingdoms of the then known World were ſubject to his juriſdiction. This is thus proved. By <hi>Heaven</hi> is typified the <hi>Earth;</hi> for it is very evident that the things which are here ſaid to have bin ſeen in <hi>Heaven,</hi> were really tranſacted on the <hi>Earth.</hi> But the Scene is laid in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to repreſent (as hath bin ſaid) the Woman's <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purity</hi> under Perſecution. The <hi>caſting down to the Earth</hi> is a typical phraſe, to ſignifie <hi>ſubduing,</hi> or <hi>overcoming.</hi> This appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 9. where the Victory of <hi>Michael</hi> over the Dragon is expreſt by his <hi>caſting him down to the Earth.</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:38410:100"/>Wherefore by the Dragon's <hi>casting the Stars of Heaven down to the Earth,</hi> muſt be meant his <hi>ſubduing</hi> and <hi>overcoming</hi> them. By <hi>the third part of the Stars of Heaven</hi> therefore, which the Dragon's Tail is ſaid <hi>to have drawn, and caſt them to the Earth,</hi> muſt be meant a third part of ſomething <hi>on the Earth,</hi> which the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors held in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by right of Conqueſt. And what could that be but a third part of the Kingdoms of the then known World? And conſequently the <hi>twelve Stars</hi> in the Woman's <hi>Crown,</hi> will ſignifie by a plain Analogy, all the Apoſtolical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Roman Empire, not caſt down to the Earth by her, or made to truckle under her, but worn as a moſt glorious <hi>Crown,</hi> or Ornament on her <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Roman Dragon being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as to his features and appendixes, the next thing to be conſidered are his qualities: that we may ſee how well they anſwer to his ſhape and name. Of theſe therefore it is ſaid, That <hi>the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38410:101"/>ſtood before the Woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born.</hi> Which is a manifeſt alluſion to the Perſecution of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And the plain meaning of the Types here uſed is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Dragon [the Heathen Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors] ſtood before the Woman [the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] which was juſt under his Eye, as ſhe was ready to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (that is, as ſhe was buſied in gaining Proſelytes) to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born, or to deſtroy her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the infancy of their profeſſion of the Faith. The like to which we muſt underſtand to have bin done by the Roman Deputies, in all the <hi>Stars</hi> or Provinces ſubject to the Dragon's Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, who perſecuted the <hi>twelve Stars</hi> or Apoſtolical Churches of the Roman Empire that were conſpicuous in the Woman's Crown, with like watchfull rage and malice as the Dragon did the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for all this the Woman <hi>brought
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:38410:101"/>forth a Man-Child, who was to rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron: And her Child was caught up to God, and to his Throne.</hi> This was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, a truly Maſculine Emperor, as appeared by his zeal and vigour in the Churches Service. Which <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moſes,</hi> being wonderfully preſerv'd from the Dragon's Perſecution, was <hi>caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> that is, to the Imperial Throne. For becauſe the <hi>Earth</hi> is typified by the <hi>Heaven,</hi> it was but reaſonable and analogous to that fundamental Type, that the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> the Supream <hi>Miniſters</hi> and Vice-gerents of <hi>God</hi> on Earth (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls the Heathen Emperors, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii.) ſhould be typified by <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>their Throne</hi> by <hi>his.</hi> This <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> I ſay, was like another <hi>Moſes,</hi> in being won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved from the Dragon's vigilent fury, and exalted to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Government of the People of God, to be their Saviour and Deliverer out of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecution. And becauſe he was to ſave the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:38410:102"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed by a borrowed Type, which other-where we find applied to our Saviour Chriſt. Of whom it is ſaid in the ſecond <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as here of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> That, <hi>he ſhould rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron.</hi> But in that the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Chriſtian <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, is expreſſed by his being <hi>caught up to God, and to his Throne;</hi> it is to be explained by an eaſie and familiar <hi>Hendiadis,</hi> as if it had bin ſaid, <hi>to the Throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſo ſoon as ever the Church had gotten a Chriſtian Emperor, ſhe preſently begins to change her State, the face of all things being altered with her. For hereupon it is ſaid at ver. 6. That <hi>ſhe fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there a thouſand two hundred and ſixty days.</hi> Which her flying into the Wilderneſs is afterwards more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcribed, with the manner how, the Perſecution which then hapned to her, together with the means whereby
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38410:102"/>the Dragon, who before had perſecuted her by the Emperors, was diſappointed in his deſign upon her at this time alſo. But here the Spirit only hinteth at her flying into the Wilderneſs, to give us notice, that this change of her Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hapned under the firſt Emperor of her own Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But what is meant by this Type, <hi>the Wilderneſs?</hi> I anſwer. As in many other places of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> (even almoſt throughout the whole Prophecy) the Types are borrowed from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation; ſo here the holy Spirit, intending to ſet forth the various For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, deſcribes it with a manifeſt reference to the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</hi> The Compariſon is laid thus; The ſtate of Chriſt's Church under her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Perſecutors, is likened to that of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (for there alſo the Egyptian

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38410:103"/>Her ſtate under her Chriſtian Emperors is likened to that of the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in her paſſage to the Wilderneſs. For theſe, like <hi>Moſes,</hi> reſcued her out of her <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecution, and ſet her ſafe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs. Her ſtate under the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of her own Biſhops, when ſhe was out of fear (as it might ſeem) of Perſecution from the ſecular power; is likened to the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, when they were clean eſcaped from the Hoſt of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and ſecure of danger by the interpoſition of that Sea wherein their Perſecutours were overwhelmed. And as the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs ſoon Apoſtatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Idolatry:</hi> ſo here the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, in token of the ſame tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is ſtigmatiz'd with that opprobrious name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>the Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.</hi> But as ſomething has bin ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of this State of her's upon the xviith Chapter, ſo more remains here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be ſaid upon the xii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:38410:103"/>
               <p>In the mean time the Spirit gives us to underſtand by what means it came to paſs that the Church was thus Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over her ſo potent Perſecutors. And this is done in the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in theſe words. And <hi>there was war in Heaven;</hi> Michael <hi>and his Angels fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels; and prevailed not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was their place found any more in Heaven, ver.</hi> 7, 8. The meaning of which in general is this; That the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victorious by the Arms and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of thoſe glorious Champions that fought for her. Which Champions of hers, that they were <hi>mortal men,</hi> though they be here typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 11. where it is ſaid of them with relation to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, that <hi>they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> And indeed ſince the Scene of all things here is laid in <hi>Heaven;</hi> it was but reaſonable and analogous to that fundamental Type, to repreſent the Woman's Champions by thoſe <hi>Heavenly Spirits,</hi> who, as the Scripture ſpeaks,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38410:104"/>are <hi>great in power and might,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 11. But we muſt make a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enquiry after them, to ſee if we can find what ſort or order of Men they were by whom the Church obtained this Victory. To which end, let it be here obſerved,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That (as hath bin ſaid already) the Fate of all other Churches is here deſcribed by that of the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereupon it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, (unleſs we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that moſt excellent conſtitution of the Types here uſed) that the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions alſo of all other Churches ſhould be repreſented by the Champions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empler of all Chriſtian Vertues to the Catholick Church, <hi>her Faith being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of</hi> (as <hi>St. Paul</hi> tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>throughout the whole World.</hi> In the next place let it be obſerved, that the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions on the Heathen ſide are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>the Dragon and his Angels.</hi> Now ſince the <hi>Dragon</hi> repreſents the <hi>Heathen Emperors,</hi> what can be typified
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38410:104"/>by <hi>his Angels,</hi> but <hi>their under-Officers?</hi> For as good Angels are the <hi>Miniſtring Spirits</hi> of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. ſo are bad Angels of the Dragon. As therefore by the <hi>Dragon</hi> are meant the <hi>Emperors</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo by <hi>his Angels</hi> are meant thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> of State within that City, which were in Authority under them.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, we may eaſily perceive what ſort of Men they were within the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that were the Woman's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and are here typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels.</hi> For as the <hi>Dragon</hi> on the one ſide is the Prince of the evil Angels, and repreſents the <hi>Emperors:</hi> ſo
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Dan. 10.13, 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> on the other ſide is a Prince of good Angels, and muſt therefore by the neceſſary Analogy of the Types repreſent ſome <hi>leading ſort of Perſons</hi> on the Woman's ſide. In a word therefore, <hi>Michael and his Angels</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot be underſtood of any but of the <hi>Roman Biſhops, and the inferior Clergy.</hi> The <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:38410:105"/>being typified by the Arch-Angel <hi>Michael,</hi> as the <hi>Emperors</hi> by the <hi>Dragon:</hi> and the <hi>inferior Clergy</hi> by Michael's <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate Angels</hi> or miniſtring Spirits, as the <hi>under-miniſters</hi> of the Emperors by the Dragon's <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although this only conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature and analogy of the Types might be ſufficient to confirm this Expoſition: yet we ſhall further offer theſe two Reaſons for the Reader's fuller ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is typified by the <hi>Woman,</hi> v. 1, 4. her <hi>Converts</hi> by her <hi>Child, v.</hi> 2, 4. her <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſors</hi> in general are expreſſed by the name of <hi>Brethren.</hi> They therefore that are typified as her <hi>Champions,</hi> by this peculiar Type of <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> cannot well be underſtood, either of the Roman <hi>Church</hi> in general, or in general of her <hi>Converts,</hi> or the <hi>Brethren,</hi> but of ſome ſpecial <hi>leading Perſons</hi> in that Chriſtian Warfare. And that theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were that Churches Paſtors, I come now to prove in my ſecond Argument.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:38410:105"/>2. For it is obſervable of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> that they are ſaid at ver. 11, to have <hi>overcome</hi> the Dragon <hi>by the word of their Teſtimony,</hi> that is, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and undaunted preaching of the Word of God. For to teſtifie the Word of God, is one of the moſt uſual Phraſes of the New-Teſtament to expreſs <hi>the preaching of the Word.</hi> And though it be uſed in that ſence near forty or fifty times, yet is it never applied to any perſons, but only ſuch as were peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commiſſionated to the preaching of the Word. I ſhall therefore only name ſome few places in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where this word is uſed, that we may ſee whether it be any otherwiſe taken there or not. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.2. <hi>St. John</hi> is ſaid to have born <hi>record</hi> (or to have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) <hi>of the Word of God, and of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> i. e. to have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or preached the Goſpel. Again, <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. we have much mention of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and their <hi>propheſying,</hi> and their <hi>teſtimony:</hi> which I ſuppoſe there is no
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:38410:106"/>Man underſtands otherwiſe than of <hi>Preachers</hi> and their <hi>Preaching.</hi> And to name no more places, in the end of this xiith Chapter, the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Church are accordingly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from the <hi>Laity by their having the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> where it is ſaid, That <hi>the Dragon was wroth with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and went to make War with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her Seed, which keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> i. e. with the <hi>Saints, Rev.</hi> xiii. 7. and their <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or Preachers, <hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 3, 7. They therefore who are here typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> and are ſaid to have <hi>overcome</hi> the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon by <hi>the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony,</hi> muſt needs be underſtood of the <hi>Roman Biſhops,</hi> and their <hi>Clergy,</hi> the Miniſters, and Preachers of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>To which conſiderations if we add thoſe places in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Chapters, where advices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Angels:</hi> as the proper Arguments drawn from thoſe places will give ſtrength to this: ſo the proper Arguments of this place, will add ſtrength to thoſe; and one will make the other undeniable.</p>
               <p>And yet when I affirm, that by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and his Angels</hi> here, no other ſort of Men are typified, but the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> and their <hi>Clergy</hi> only; I mean, no others are <hi>immediately</hi> typified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: But, by way of <hi>concomitancy,</hi> all other Saints and Members of that Church are ſignified: But the Biſhops and the Clergy only are expreſſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an uſual thing in ſuch caſes, to aſcribe Victories, not to common Souldiers, but their chief Commanders. And by this way of concomitancy, are underſtood not the Biſhops, Clergy, and other Chriſtians of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only; but of all other Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. As on the other ſide, by the Dragon and his Angels are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not only the Emperors, and their under Officers of State in <hi>Rome;</hi> but their Vice-gerents alſo, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:38410:107"/>under-Officers in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Roman Empire.</p>
               <p>Now as to the iſſue or event of this War, it is ſaid, That <hi>the Dragon and his Angels prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in Heaven;</hi> that is, they were caſt down to the Earth, or overcome.</p>
               <p>And that we may underſtand, that it was not only the Heathen Emperors, and whatever other perſons in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under them, typified by the Dragon and his Angels; becauſe they were the more immediate inſtruments of thoſe wicked Spirits in upholding their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and perſecuting the Servants of the only true God; we are told in the next verſe, that it was really the Devil and his Angels, whoſe ſhape their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruments are repreſented in, and whoſe work they did, that were ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, that is, depriv'd of that Power and Tyranny, which by thoſe Heathen Emperors they exerciſed over the bodies of Chriſtians, and the Souls of their deluded worſhipers. The words
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:38410:107"/>are theſe, <hi>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World; he was cast out into the Earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him.</hi> v.9.</p>
               <p>Now that this War between <hi>Michael and his Angels</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Dragon and his Angels</hi> on the other ſide, was before the Woman's flying into the Wilderneſs, nay, before her Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God, may be thus proved. When the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was overcome, his Angels were overcome at the ſame time: But the Dragon was overcome in his Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, the Heathen perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: Therefore his Angels were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then alſo. Now the Heathen Perſecuting Emperors were overcome, when the Woman's <hi>Man-child was caught up unto the Throne of God:</hi> Therefore the War wherein they were overcome, was before the Woman's Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God.</p>
               <p>Neither may it here be objected, that <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate was after this an
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38410:108"/>Heathen Perſecutor; for he was but one amongſt many Chriſtian Emperors, and therefore is not particularly taken notice of, but belongs to the next Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, where the <hi>Christian Emperors</hi> are repreſented by the <hi>two wings of a great Eagle.</hi> And it is manifeſt, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in her flight before <hi>Julian</hi>'s time. For ſhe is ſaid to have fled into the Wilderneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. ſo ſoon as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Man-Child, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, was caught up to the Throne of God. Wherefore <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate who did not reign till after that time, cannot be concerned in the War which was before. But this will appear more plainly, when we come to ſpeak of the next Period of the Church in her declining ſtate, while ſhe was flying upon thoſe <hi>two Wings of the great Eagle,</hi> ver. 14. from Heaven to Earth, from the Egyptian Perſecution into the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Again, That this War was before the Woman's flying into the Wilderneſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where it is ſaid, that <hi>when the Dragon ſaw that be
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:38410:108"/>was caſt unto the Earth, he perſecuted the Woman that brought forth the Man-Child.</hi> And this Perſecution was while the Woman was upon the Eagle's wings, as appears by what follows. Whence it is evident, that the Dragon had not done any thing mentioned in this Prophecy, from the time that he was caſt down to the Earth, till the time of the Woman's flying into the Wilderneſs. The War therefore wherein the Dragon was caſt down to the Earth, was before the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's flying into the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> And that it was before the Woman's <hi>Manchild</hi> was caught up to the Throne of God alſo, may appear from hence, in that ſo ſoon as ever the Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God, without any delay, the Woman is ſaid to have <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs,</hi> ver. 5, 6. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore underſtand this War of any other time, than while the Dragon was watching to devour the Woman's Off-ſpring; and that both ſhe her ſelf, with all her Off-ſpring, were preſerv'd from the Dragon's fury, and eſcap'd out
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:38410:109"/>of her Egyptian Perſecution under the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors, through the Proweſs of her Champions, <hi>Michael and his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, why is there mention made of the Woman's flying into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo ſoon as ever her Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God, if ſhe did not preſently thereupon begin to take her flight? And why is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſcription of her Flight ſuſpended till after the account given of the War, and the Joy that followed thereupon; if the War had not hapned before her flying into the Wilderneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, before her Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God? And why is there no voice of rejoycing heard in the Church upon the Woman's Man-Child's being caught up to the Throne of God; as well as on the caſting down of the Dragon and his Angels? Was it not becauſe the catching up to the Throne of God, and the caſting down the Dragon to the Earth, were Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, and hapned both together, and ſo the Joy is for them both? Let theſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:38410:109"/>things be well conſidered, and I doubt not but the thing I contend for will not be denied.</p>
               <p>Now preſently upon this Victory is deſcribed the Church's Joy and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in it, in theſe words: <hi>And I heard aloud voice,</hi> ſaying, <hi>in Heaven, Now is come Salvation, and the Kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt: For the Accuſer of our Brethren is caſt down:</hi> (that is, thoſe vile Slanderers, the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that great Accuſer <hi>Satan,</hi> are defeated) <hi>which accuſed them before God day and night,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> which with malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Slanders were unceſſantly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt Holy Faith and Pure Lives of Chriſtian People, before our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.) And here again the Emperors are typified by God, (as before at <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>their Throne is called, The Throne of God</hi>) becauſe this being ſpoken in the Perſons of rejoycing Chriſtians, the Spirit would not teach them to call their Emperors, though Heathen Men and Perſecutors, by the name of <hi>Dragons,</hi> but to look upon them (as indeed they were by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:38410:110"/>as the Miniſters of God, and his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Vice-gerents upon Earth, and call them Gods. Which ſhould teach all Chriſtians modeſt language towards thoſe that God has ſet in Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; agreeable to that Maxim in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which <hi>St. Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to wicked Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> xxiii. 5.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>ver.</hi> 11. there follows the manner of their obtaining this Victory: And they <hi>overcame him</hi> (the Dragon) <hi>by the Blood of the Lamb</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt) <hi>and by the word of their Teſtimony</hi> (the Preaching of his Goſpel;) <hi>and they loved not their Lives unto the Death,</hi> (but were ready to ſeal their Preaching with their Deaths.)</p>
               <p>Whereupon in the beginning of <hi>ver.</hi> 12. we have this ſhort <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Hymn, by way of congratulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Victory to them, in theſe words; <hi>Therefore rejoyce ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them.</hi> And preſently upon this, a Veil is drawn over the whole face <hi>of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:38410:110"/>Heaven,</hi> and all upon the ſudden the Scene of things is ſhifted to the <hi>Earth.</hi> For it follows in the very next words: <hi>Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. And thus much of the pure Primitive ſtate of the Church, in reſpect of which ſhe is repreſented as in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And becauſe the Church is thought fit to be repreſented there, her Perſecutors are repreſented there alſo. So that by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (the Scene of all thoſe Actions, that were done by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c. till the <hi>Woman's</hi> Man-child was caught up to the Throne of God, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his Angels were caſt down to the Earth) is meant the <hi>Earth</hi> for about three hundred and ten years, to wit, in the primitive times of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, till the Church began to decline and take her flight into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> upon the aſſumption of her Man-child, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, to the Imperial Throne. From that time the Woman is repreſented in a lower ſtate, to wit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the <hi>Eagles Wings,</hi> or in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> in her <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate. The ſenſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:38410:111"/>then of thoſe words, <hi>Therefore rejoice, ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them,</hi> is this: Therefore let every pious Soul congratulate this your happy Victory to you, O Primitive times of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to you, O valiant, pure, and innocent Chriſtians of thoſe Primitive times, who are worthy to be accounted as the Inhabiters of Heaven.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And ſhe being zealous to gain Souls to Chriſt, did groan heavily under the Cruelty of her Perſecutors, while ſhe was employed in that excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of converting Sinners from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their ways.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And there appeared another Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the Earth at the ſame time, and behold, the Roman Heathen Emperors, the profeſſed Oppoſers of the Faith of Chriſt, and Inſtruments of the infernal <hi>Dragon, great</hi> in Power, and <hi>red</hi> with the Blood of Saints; being the ſixth King, or ſort of Supream Governors, which that City had enjoyed, to whom one more was to ſucceed when that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:38410:112"/>Empire ſhould come to be divided into ten Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And theſe Emperors had <hi>the third part</hi> of the Kingdoms of the then-known World in ſubjection to them, and they (like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecutors of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church) ſtood before the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (ſhe being in the ſame City juſt under their Eye) as ſhe was buſied in gaining Proſelytes to the Faith of Chriſt, to deſtroy them as ſoon as ever they profeſſed Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But for all their vigilant Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, ſhe obtained at the laſt a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Moſes,</hi> to deliver her out of this <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecution; and he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to the Imperial Seat to rule all Nations of the Roman Empire with a Chriſtian Scepter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And preſently hereupon ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decline from her Primitive <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Purity to an <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate, and fled upon the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> out of her <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Perſecution</hi> into ſuch a ſtate of things as was that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:</hi> in which her Wilderneſs-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:38410:112"/>God hath appointed that they ſhould feed her with ſuch things as her Soul luſteth after for the ſpace of One thouſand two hundred and ſixty years. See <hi>Com. upon Chap.</hi> xiii. 5.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But before I ſpeak particularly of her Flight into the Wilderneſs, I muſt here take notice of the means whereby ſhe eſcaped, that both her ſelf, and all her Converts were not deſtroyed by thoſe Heathen Perſecuting Emperors: which came to paſs by means of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Conflict, which I ſaw on Earth in thoſe Primitive times; the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and their inferior Clergy, fought againſt the Heathen perſecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the Heathen perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors fought, and their ſubordinate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And they could not prevail, but were overcome and utterly ſubdued in that Conteſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither was it the Heathen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Emperors that were thus van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, but in effect the <hi>Dragon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe work they did; I mean, <hi>that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:38410:113"/>old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World: He</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was that was overcome, <hi>and his Angels</hi> were overcome <hi>with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. And ſo ſoon as the Church had obtained this Victory, I heard a loud voice of rejoycing amongſt them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Now hath God ſaved us, and brought us out of this Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with a mighty hand; and inſtead of Heathen Perſecutors, we have a Chriſtian Emperor, that will advance the intereſt of the Kingdom of God, and will propagate the Goſpel, which is the power of his Chriſt unto Salvation: for thoſe vile ſlanderers of our Brethren, thoſe inſtruments of the grand Accuſer, are defeated, who never ceaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their pure and innocent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and ſo to render them odious to our Emperors, God's Vice-gerents.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And they overcame him by ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, and by their undaunted preaching of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; ſealing and being ready to ſeal it with their Deaths.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:38410:113"/>12. Therefore let every pious ſoul congratulate this moſt glorious victory to you, O Heavenly times of Primitive purity, and to you, O pure, couragious Champions of the Chriſtian Faith that lived in them, and may be likened to the Inhabiters of Heaven.</p>

And therein of the</hi> Airy <hi>or Declining State of the</hi> Roman Catholick Church, <hi>while ſhe is flying out of her</hi> Egyptian <hi>Perſecution into the</hi> Wilderneſs, <hi>upon the</hi> two Wings of the great Eagle, <hi>the</hi> Chriſtian Emperors, (<hi>who were that</hi> King <hi>of ſhort continuance, not come in St.</hi> John's <hi>time, nor typed by any head of the</hi> Blaſphemous Beaſt,) <hi>with a</hi> Paraphraſe <hi>ſubjoined.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE come now to ſpeak of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> (and in her, of the Catholick) Church; which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:38410:114"/>was no fixed ſtate, but only like the paſſage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> a falling from her Heavenly Primitive Purity to a ſtate of Earthly Feculency and Corruption. And as to this declining ſtate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, there are theſe following Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars moſt remarkable in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe times in general, (I ſpeak the ſence of all thoſe Hiſtories, and therefore I cite none.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in this ſhort Period the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were Chriſtian, I ſpeak of theſe Emperors in general: as for <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, he was but one ſingle Emperor, the reſt were all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in this Period the Roman Empire was divided into two Parts, one Emperor reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and the other at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the Eaſtern part of it. And for this Reaſon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is now typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at <hi>ver.</hi> 14, by <hi>two wings of a great Eagle</hi> (an Eagle being the Banner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.) And becauſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:38410:114"/>at this time were Chriſtian, the Woman is repreſented as being born up on their <hi>wings.</hi> And this is that wch was alſo obſerved out of the xviith Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>other King</hi> of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, (who was to ſucceed the then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigning King, the Heathen Emperors) was to be no <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Blaſphemous Beaſt;</hi> for accordingly we ſee him here typed by <hi>two wings of a great Eagle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Devil, who is ſtill called the <hi>Dragon,</hi> though he could not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Woman as before with open violence, becauſe the Emperors were now Chriſtian: yet he did it in another manner, by pouring out a flood of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies after her, inſomuch that ſhe was in danger of being carried away with it. For even <hi>Liberius,</hi> one of her Biſhops, is generally acknowledged to have bin infected with the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie. But yet it is obſervable,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Roman Biſhops in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were not only the greateſt Aſſiſtants of that particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſaving her from the violence of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:38410:115"/>of thoſe times, and drying up this flood that was intended for her ruine; but alſo of all other Churches of the Roman Empire. For in the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> (ſome ſay of <hi>Nice</hi>) it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That Men unjuſtly condemned by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> ſhould have refuge to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who at that time was <hi>Julius:</hi> to whom therefore they gave Power anew again to judge their Cauſe. And whether this were a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honour conferr'd on <hi>Julius</hi> alone, or not, it is certain that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in general had the greateſt hand in quelling and appeaſing the Hereſies of theſe times. For to them the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox fled for refuge, the Hereticks for appeal. And from theſe times it is that our Romaniſts fetch ſome of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Arguments for their Pope's Supream Authority in deciding matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But yet,</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is obſervable in this Period, That the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> enjoying freedom from Perſecution, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with large Incomes from the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:38410:115"/>bounty and devotion of their Emperors and of other holy perſons, and making uſe of thoſe advantages of appeals, and refuge and addreſſes to them which were made from other Churches: did manifeſtly appear to be in a declining ſtate, by graſping after worldly wealth, and indeavouring upon all occaſions to advance the honour of their See, and ſubjugate all other Churches to them. And hence it was there aroſe ſo much contention between them and other Churches, and ſpecially the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about Preeminence. And that we may ſee to what a degree of Avarice they were now arriv'd, we muſt know, that the Emperor <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> were fain to make a Law to inhibit Widows, under pretence of Devotion, to leave their Treaſures to the Church (which it ſeems the Clergy of thoſe times much thirſted after) to the utter impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and undoing of their Children.</p>
               <p>To which we may add laſtly, That the Woman her ſelf did in this Period mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:38410:116"/>decline alſo to thoſe Idolatries, and Superſtitions in which ſhe fryed afterwards, by growing fond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Pictures, Images, Monuments, and introducing Heathen Rites, which though they did but now begin to ſhew themſelves, did yet within a little ſpace of time diffuſe themſelves over the face of the whole Church, and found ſo good entertainment with this poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Woman, that ſhe almoſt exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her Religion for them, and became more zealous for theſe Fopperies, than for Faith or Holineſs, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Oppoſers of them to the Death.</p>
               <p>And now theſe things being premiſed in general concerning the ſtate of the Church, and particularly of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in this ſecond Period, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is more at large deſcribed in the Hiſtories of thoſe times: I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a further examination of the particulars of the Prophecy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this Period; we have it in theſe words:</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:38410:116"/>
               <p>Verſ. 12. — <hi>Wo to the Inhabiters of the Earth, and of the Sea: for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the Earth, he perſecuted the Woman which brought forth the Man-Child.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>And to the Woman were given two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might fly into the Wilderneſs, into her place: where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And the Serpent caſt out of his mouth waters as a flood, after the Woman; that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>And the Earth helped the Woman, and the Earth opened her mouth, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>And the Dragon was wroth with the Woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her Seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:38410:117"/>
               <p>The Inhabiters of the <hi>Earth</hi> were in the former Period ſtyled the Inhabiters of <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe all. paſſages of that Period are repreſented as if they had bin done in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The Woman <hi>was cloathed with the Sun, having the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars.</hi> The Dragon (who is therefore repreſented in Heaven, becauſe he perſecutes the Woman, who for her Purity of Faith, and Heavenlineſs of Converſation for that time, is thought ſit to be repreſented there) <hi>drew in his Tail the third part of the Stars of Heaven.</hi> And the Combatants (who were but mortal men, becauſe the Scene was Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) are typified by Angels.</p>
               <p>But, now the Scene is changed to a lower Region, and the Woman not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Starry Firmament as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but flying downward upon the Eagles wings. Her place therefore as yet is in the Air, though the moſt grave and ponderous (ſhall I call it? or moſt earthy, groſs, and feculent) part of her, to wit, her <hi>Helpers</hi> (by which I fear
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:38410:117"/>are meant her earthly-minded, covetous, and ambitious Clergy) are repreſented as on <hi>Earth,</hi> while yet the Woman is on <hi>Eagle's wings.</hi> But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time let us examin what is meant by the <hi>Earth,</hi> and who by the <hi>Inhabiters</hi> of it. For the <hi>Earth</hi> is now oppoſed both to <hi>Heaven,</hi> as to a more pure ſtate of things that was before it; and to the <hi>Sea,</hi> as ſignifying another ſtate of things coordinate with it. The <hi>Earth</hi> therefore being here ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Sea,</hi> and not (as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in oppoſition to the <hi>Heaven</hi> only: as it muſt ſignifie an <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate of things ſucceeding to that <hi>Heavenly;</hi> ſo it muſt alſo ſignify ſomething, as it ſtands oppoſed to the <hi>Sea.</hi> But that the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſignifies a corrupted ſtate of things, as it ſtands in oppoſition to the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſtate, will eaſily appear from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions that are given us of theſe two ſtates; of the <hi>Heavenly, Rev.</hi> xii. 1, &amp;c. of the <hi>Earthly, Rev.</hi> xiii. where the Eagles wings are no more heard of, and conſequently the Woman is arriv'd at
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:38410:118"/>her <hi>Earthly-Wilderneſs-condition.</hi> And in token thereof, we there find one Beaſt, or Kingdom, ariſing out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> ver. 1. and another coming up out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> ver. 11. and this is the firſt time we find the Earth and Sea inhabited, after the Woman's flight into the Wilderneſs. To this ſtate of things it is therefore, that the <hi>Wo</hi> is chiefly to be referred, which is denounced at the firſt ſhifting of the Scene, or firſt appearance of declining, in theſe words, <hi>Wo to the Inhabiters of the Earth, and of the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> But what is meant by <hi>the Earth</hi> as it ſtands oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>the Sea?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to this let it be obſerved, That <hi>the Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>the Inhabiters of the Sea</hi> are two ſeveral ſorts of People: and the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> are to be look'd upon as two diſtinct places. Which manifeſtly appears from <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii, where one <hi>Beaſt</hi> is ſaid to have riſen <hi>out of the Sea,</hi> and another <hi>out of the Earth.</hi> And indeed we find the Earth and the Sea ſo often oppoſed in this Book, that there muſt needs be ſome
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:38410:118"/>notable difference between them: See <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. 1, 2, 3. &amp; viii. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. &amp; x. 2. &amp; xi. 6. &amp; xiv. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what the meaning of both is, will eaſily be perceived, if we call to mind what has bin already
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Part</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> ſaid concerning the Diſpoſition of the Scheme of the Viſion, exhibited <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. For there the Woman (the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) is repreſented ſituate upon <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> or <hi>Mountains,</hi> as on an Iſland over-topping the main Ocean, with the <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> that were ſubject to her Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as ſo many <hi>Waters</hi> compaſſing her on every ſide. From whence we may conclude, that by <hi>the Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> are meant the Inhabiters of the City or Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and by <hi>the Inhabiters of the Sea,</hi> are deſigned the <hi>Peoples, Nations, Multitudes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tongues</hi> that were diffuſed as <hi>Waters</hi> round about her. And in this manner the condition of the Roman Empire being repreſented to <hi>St. John</hi> in Viſion, in the time of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38410:119"/>laſt Head, he is ſaid to have ſeen one Beaſt (to wit, the ten-horned) riſing out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and another out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> Rev. xiii. 1, 2. That is, he ſaw ten Kings ariſing in the Roman Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and another out of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But of this more hereafter in the xiiith Chapter.</p>
               <p>Thus then we are to underſtand the <hi>Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> when they are oppoſed to the <hi>Inhabiters of the Sea;</hi> or to any <hi>Waters;</hi> or to that which is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by <hi>Waters,</hi> to wit, <hi>Peoples,</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Multitudes,</hi> and <hi>Tongues.</hi> But otherwiſe it may well enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit its proper literal ſignification. But this Notion of theſe <hi>Inhabitants</hi> is not ſo fully applicable to the Woman's <hi>Airy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> while ſhe is flying on the <hi>Eagle's wings;</hi> as afterwards, when ſhe is come into the Wilderneſs, to her earthly ſtate. Although it has its uſe here too, as we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Wo</hi> then at <hi>ver.</hi> 12, is denounced againſt the Woman, and the Nations whom ſhe ſhall ſeduce, with reference
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:38410:119"/>to that Earthly ſtate, to which ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining. And the meaning of it is this, Wo to the Inhabiters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Nations ſubject to the Roman Juriſdiction, for the Devil being overcome by the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in the War which he waged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by <hi>Rome</hi>'s Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, is now come to deceive you as he did them, and ſubſtitute you to be his Inſtruments of Perſecution and Idolatry in their ſtead; and this deſign he means to proſecute upon you with all his might, being very angry at the Defeat he hath received, and ſenſible withal that he hath but a ſhort time remaining to deceive the World in, in compariſon of thoſe many Years he hath ſpent already in that Work.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable at <hi>ver.</hi> 17, that the Woman being fled into the Wilderneſs, the Dragon is no longer ſaid to have made War with <hi>Her,</hi> but only <hi>with a Remnant</hi> (that is, a few ſelected Perſons) <hi>of her Seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38410:120"/>the Teſtimony of Jeſus Christ.</hi> From thenceforth therefore the Woman is not perſecuted, but deceived (as you may ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii;) and the War is made only againſt a <hi>Remnant of her Seed,</hi> ſhe being then become the chief Inſtrument of the Dragon in promoting Idol-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and perſecuting that pious Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her Children that refuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her in it, and reprove he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Superſtitions and Corruptions. But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, let us hear an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſecond Perſecution which the <hi>Dragon</hi> is now projecting againſt the <hi>Woman,</hi> as ſhe is <hi>flying into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> It begins with theſe words: <hi>And when the Dragon ſaw that he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> caſt unto the Earth, he perſecuted the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which brought forth the Man-Child.</hi> Theſe laſt words point out to us the time when the ſecond Perſecution was begun, as well as the occaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it hapned. For hence it follows, that the Dragon had not done any Exploit againſt the Woman ſince her
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:38410:120"/>
                  <hi>bringing forth the Man-Child, which was caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> ver. 5, till now that he is preparing this new Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem againſt her, to overwhelm her with <hi>a flood of waters,</hi> as ſhe is <hi>flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs.</hi> For ſo ſoon as ever the Woman's <hi>Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> it is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 6, that <hi>ſhe fled into the Wilderneſs.</hi> And as ſhe was flying into the Wilderneſs (for then it was, as appears by the following verſes) the Dragon rallies up his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and begins to perſecute her a ſecond time. So that the War, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed at the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth verſes, wherein the Dragon is ſaid to have bin <hi>cast down to the Earth,</hi> though it be ſet after the firſt mention of the Woman's flying into the Wilderneſs, yet is to be underſtood to have bin waged againſt her before her Man-Child was caught up to the Throne of God. For <hi>when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt down to the Earth</hi> (which was done by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and his Angels</hi> in the War before deſcribed) <hi>he</hi> went and <hi>perſecuted the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38410:121"/>Woman, which had brought forth the Man-Child,</hi> as ſhe was flying into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
               <p>The War therefore wherein the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was caſt down to the Earth, was contemporary with his firſt Perſecution of the Woman, before ſhe had brought forth her Man-Child. For therefore it is ſo preciſely noted here, that the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon perſecuted the Woman which had brought forth the Man-Child: that we might take notice that the Dragon had not perſecuted her, nor made War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, ſince her bringing forth the Man-Child, till now that he being caſt down to the Earth, and her Man-Child aſſumed to the Throne of God, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes her as ſhe is ſlying into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
               <p>Now as to the meaning of the Types that are uſed in this 13th verſe, they having all relation to the former Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, where the Scene was <hi>Heaven,</hi> muſt be interpreted in the ſame ſence as there they have bin uſed in. Only the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſince he was caſt down to the Earth,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:38410:121"/>and in his ſtead the Woman's Man-Child caught up to the Imperial Throne, is not to be underſtood as having <hi>ſeven Heads and ten Horns</hi> (according as he is deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.) that is, as perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the means of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors: but as he is deſcribed at <hi>ver.</hi> 9, where he is called <hi>that old Serpent, the Devil and Satan;</hi> to intimate to us, that the prime Author of this ſecond Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is the ſame with that of the firſt; only he being now dethroned, is forced to make uſe of meaner inſtruments, and another ſort of Perſecution. Thus then we may expreſs the meaning of this thirteenth verſe: And when the Devil ſaw that he was worſted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in his firſt Attempt, he ſought by other means to perſecute the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> now ſhe had gotten a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperor.</p>
               <p>Which preparation and intention of the Dragon being thus declared, there follows in the 14th verſe, a deſcription of the Woman's ſecond ſtate, to wit, the ſtate of her <hi>declenſion</hi> from her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:38410:122"/>Purity, to which the Dragon now accommodates this ſecond Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is deſcribed in theſe words; <hi>And to the Woman were given two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might fly into the Wilderneſs, into her place: where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent.</hi> Here then we have the Woman in her <hi>Airy ſtate,</hi> upon the <hi>Eagle's wings,</hi> as flying down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth,</hi> and haſting from the face of her <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecutors, to that unhappy (though too much deſired) ſtate of Eaſe and Peace, and Worldly Wealth, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Pomp, and reſt from Perſecution, which is prepared for her <hi>in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let it be obſerved here, That as the <hi>Woman</hi> (or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) is now changing her condition: ſo the <hi>Politick ſtate</hi> of the Roman Empire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a very notable Mutation with her. For whereas the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> were before typified by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> (whereby is ſignified that they were
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:38410:122"/>profeſſed Enemies of the Church of Chriſt) without any intimation of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Empire: they are here contrariwiſe repreſented to us under the Type of <hi>two wings of a great Eagle;</hi> to intimate the Diviſion of the Roman Empire, (whoſe Banner was an <hi>Eagle</hi>) into <hi>two</hi> parts or <hi>wings,</hi> adminiſtred by a pair of Emperors in this ſecond Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. And becauſe theſe Emperors were the Woman's Friends, they are not only repreſented by a pair of wings, but are alſo ſaid to have bin <hi>given to the Woman,</hi> to wit, to bear her gently to the place, or ſtate, that ſhe was haſting to.</p>
               <p>And further, let us here obſerve the parallel of this deſcription of the ſtate of the Roman Empire, with that which the Angel gives <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 10, 11. where he tells us of <hi>ſeven Kings</hi> typiſied by <hi>ſeven Heads;</hi> and between the ſixth and and ſeventh of them puts in <hi>another</hi> King, not typified by any Head. A King he was to be, of the ſame dignity with the other ſeven, but not of the ſame nature with them, not any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:38410:123"/>of the blaſphemous Beaſt, nor of the number of thoſe Kings that are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by his Heads. So that in the time of this King, the Blaſphemots Beaſt might ſeem to have received a mortal wound, as being deprived of his Head. But it was not long after when by the artifice of the Dragon, upon the failing of the Eagles Wings, this deadly wound was healed by the ſubſtitution of another Head, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. 1, 3. Here then let us compare this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, with what the Angel tells us of the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt, and of the other King of ſhort continuance, that was to interpoſe between the ſixth and ſeventh Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>He tells us therefore that <hi>five</hi> of thoſe Kings were <hi>faln,</hi> and ſo there is of them no further mention, neither are they repreſented, as the others are, by their reſpective and peculiar Types. But he adds, that <hi>one is;</hi> and he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in this xiith <hi>Chapter</hi> we are now upon, by <hi>a great red Dragon</hi> with <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> crowned, but <hi>ten Horns</hi> uncrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:38410:123"/>Becauſe the <hi>Heads</hi> had bin, and were at that preſent in poſſeſſion of their Kingdom, but the <hi>Horns</hi> were not. This Dragon therefore is <hi>the one that is,</hi> to wit, that in <hi>St. John</hi>'s time reigned. <hi>The other</hi> (ſays the Angel) <hi>is not yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Chriſtian Emperors therefore are not thought fit to be repreſented by any Beaſt or Head, but the Angel vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes them a peculiar mention by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being none of that Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crew; and accordingly they are here typified in the xiith Chapter, not by any <hi>Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> as the Heathen Emperors are by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> ver. 3. and the ten Kingdoms under the Headſhip
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:38410:124"/>and Supremacy of the Idolatrous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, by the <hi>Leopard,</hi> Rev. xiii. 2; but by <hi>two wings</hi> of a great <hi>Eagle.</hi> And whereas the Angel tells us of theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperors, that <hi>they ſhould continue but a ſhort ſpace:</hi> his words are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly anſwered by what is ſaid of theſe <hi>two wings of the great Eagle,</hi> which ſerved only for the Woman's flight into the Wilderneſs, (which was as quick a way of paſſing thither as poſſible) and then they vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>two wings</hi> then <hi>of the great Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> were given to the Woman, that ſhe might fly into the <hi>Wilderneſs into her place.</hi> What is meant by the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> hath been before explained at <hi>ver.</hi> 6, where it is ſaid, that in the <hi>Wilderneſs God hath prepared for the Woman a place.</hi> And agreeably thereunto it is here ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 14, that <hi>ſhe fled into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into her place.</hi> But what <hi>place</hi> is this that ſhe fled to in the Wilderneſs? Here it muſt be obſerved, that thoſe three States of the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> That of her <hi>Egyptian</hi> Servitude under the Heathen
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:38410:124"/>Emperors; That of her <hi>

                     </gap>light</hi> out of it under Chriſtian Emperors; and that of her reſt and quiet in the Wilderneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her own Biſhops: may (from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſideration of the Types by which theſe three States are otherwiſe repreſented) be expreſt by her <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> her <hi>Aiery,</hi> and her <hi>Earthly</hi> State. So that her flying into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to her flying to the <hi>Earth.</hi> Hence it is that in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii, we find her ſitting upon <hi>many Waters,</hi> and upon the <hi>ten-horned Beaſt</hi> that roſe out of the <hi>Sea;</hi> in token of her arrival at this Sublunary and Terreſtrial Globe. Wherefore by her <hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is meant her <hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Earth;</hi> and that is no other but the <hi>place</hi> where the City of <hi>Rome</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> is ſituated. In this place (<hi>viz.</hi> upon the <hi>ſeven Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>) we muſt conceive that the <hi>two wings of the great Eagle</hi> ſet the Woman down, when they had brought her gently to the <hi>Earth.</hi> By which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was now degenerated from her primitive
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:38410:125"/>
                  <hi>Heavenly</hi> Purity, and coming into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of this World, a <hi>Maze</hi> or Labyrinth of <hi>Secular</hi> Buſineſſes; and that at ſuch a time, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire through the Incurſions of the Barbarous Nations, was nothing elſe but a <hi>deſolate Wilderneſs,</hi> as the Prophets often phraſe it.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>place</hi> then ſhe is nouriſhed (to wit, with ſuch things as ſhe, like the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after) <hi>for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent.</hi> This duration of the Woman's in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, is otherwiſe expreſſed at <hi>ver.</hi> 6. by <hi>One thouſand, two hundred, and ſixty days,</hi> which makes juſt three Years and an half, if we allow to every Year twelve Moneths, and to every Moneth thirty Days. Since therefore this Woman is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 6, to <hi>have a place in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs prepared of God for her, that they ſhould feed her there One thouſand two hundred and ſixty days.</hi> And here again it is ſaid of her, that ſhe fled into the Wilderneſs, where <hi>ſhe is nouriſhed for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:38410:125"/>time, and times, and half a time;</hi> it is evident that by <hi>a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> muſt be meant <hi>One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, two hundred, and threeſcore days;</hi> and therefore we cannot better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>a time</hi> than of <hi>a Year,</hi> or Three hundred and ſixty dayes; by which reckoning, three Years and a half will make juſt <hi>One thouſand, two hundred, and threeſcore days.</hi> And becauſe thoſe <hi>days</hi> are put for <hi>Years</hi> (as ſhall be proved hereafter in the xiiith <hi>Chapter</hi>) the three Years and half, which anſwer to thoſe <hi>one thouſand, two hundred, and threeſcore days,</hi> muſt be underſtood not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Years, conſiſting of three hundred and ſixty days, but of as many Years as days.</p>
               <p>And as for that which is added, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Woman is to be <hi>nouriſhed</hi> in the Wilderneſs ſo long a time <hi>from the face of the Serpent;</hi> the meaning is, that ſhe ſhould be preſerved there from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: as appears both from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Prophecy, where ſhe is deſcribed in her Heavenly ſtate; and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38410:126"/>alſo from the xviith <hi>Chapter,</hi> where her Eremitical Condition is ſet forth to us. For theſe words, <hi>from the face of the Serpent,</hi> have a manifeſt relation to that Type, which is uſed in the deſcription of the firſt Perſecution at <hi>ver.</hi> 4, where the Dragon is repreſented as ſtanding <hi>before</hi> the Woman; ſo that the Woman at that time was juſt before <hi>the face of the Serpent.</hi> Now therefore ſhe makes the more haſte to get away into <hi>the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, from the face of the Serpent,</hi> as deſiring by all means to be out of the reach of thoſe Afflictions, which ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered when he ſtood before her.</p>
               <p>And to this agrees that deſcription of the Woman's Eremitical Condition, which we have <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii, &amp; xvii. For from thence it plainly appears, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Woman her ſelf, nor the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Churches ſubject to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Juriſdiction, are any longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but that on the contrary, the Dragon flatters them, and takes upon him to be very friendly to them, giving to the ten-horned Beaſt his <hi>Power,</hi> and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38410:126"/>
                  <hi>Seat,</hi> and <hi>great Authority</hi> (Rev. xiii. 2.) which in effect was to give it to the Woman. For thoſe ten Kings did give it to her, as appears in that ſhe is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>ſitting</hi> on them (<hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.) that is, commanding them, and exerciſing Power and Juriſdiction over them. And to that ſeventh Head or King, who is called <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> and who (as hath bin proved) was to have his reſidence in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe ten Kings to whom <hi>the Dragon gave his Power, and Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> are ſaid <hi>to give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom.</hi> So that the Dragon now pretends to be the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Benefactor, not ſhewing his <hi>face</hi> as formerly, to afright her; but cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with ſome diſguiſe, or putting on another ſhape, that ſhe not knowing him but by his <hi>face,</hi> nor having any jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of his fair offers and pretences, might the more eaſily be deceived by him. And this is that which I had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve a little before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Woman after her coming into
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:38410:127"/>the Wilderneſs, is no longer <hi>perſecuted</hi> by the Serpent, but <hi>deceived.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the reaſon that ſhe makes ſuch haſte to get into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe is not to be <hi>perſecuted,</hi> but <hi>fed</hi> and nouriſhed, and ſo far preſerved from <hi>the face</hi> and fury <hi>of the Serpent,</hi> as to be flattered and indulged, and careſſed by him.</p>
               <p>But now though ſhe be flying into that ſo much deſired ſtate, where ſhe and the Serpent ſhall accord ſo well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: yet, as ſhe is paſſing thither, he endeavours what he can to overwhelm her. For ſo it follows at <hi>ver.</hi> 15. That <hi>the Serpent caſt out of his mouth water as a flood, after the Woman: that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood.</hi> This he did, as appears from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, while the Woman was upon the Eagle's wings, as ſhe was flying into the Wilderneſs to her Earthly ſtate.</p>
               <p>Now as in her <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction are repreſented by <hi>the Waters</hi> of the Sea, as hath been ſhewed already: ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38410:127"/>reaſon would that in her <hi>Airy</hi> ſtate, they ſhould be repreſented by <hi>the Clouds.</hi> For <hi>the Clouds</hi> have the ſame proportion to the Woman in <hi>the Air,</hi> which <hi>the Sea</hi> has to her on <hi>the Earth.</hi> And we know that <hi>Clouds</hi> are the proper fountains, from whence <hi>Flouds</hi> deſcend upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>Whereas then the Serpent is here ſaid to have <hi>caſt out of his mouth Water as a Floud, after the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. we muſt not think that the Serpent did this by himſelf without the help of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, any more than in the former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which he managed by the Heathen Emperors; or in that other afterwards deſcribed, which he carried on by the aſſiſtance of another Beaſt, nay, of the Woman her own ſelf, who is ſaid to have bin <hi>drunken with the blood of Saints.</hi> We muſt not therefore think that the Serpent himſelf poured this flood of waters out of his own mouth, but it is to be underſtood that he made the Clouds to pour it out. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>the Clouds</hi> which are the <hi>Waters</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:38410:128"/>of the Airy Region, are typified <hi>the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> ſubject to the Roman Juriſdiction; what can their <hi>pouring out of their mouth, a flood of waters,</hi> by the impulſe of the Dragon, ſigniſie, but their <hi>pouring out a flood</hi> of Heretical Teachers, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, whereby the Woman was in great danger to have bin oppreſſed, and born away with the violence of it?</p>

For, becauſe the Woman is repreſented in the Air is a declining ſtate, the Serpent is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented alſo with a ſuitable deſign of cauſing her to be carried away with a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:38410:128"/>violent pouring out of water after her.

And becauſe theſe Hereticks aroſe out of the Churches in Communion with the Chuch of <hi>Rome</hi> and ſo out of thoſe <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Nations, Multitudes and Tongues,</hi> which are typified by <hi>Waters (Rev.</hi> xvii. 1, 15.) theſe Hereticks alſo coming out of thoſe <hi>Waters,</hi> are yet more fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by <hi>Waters.</hi> And becauſe they are ſuppoſed to deſcend out of the Air, as being <hi>poured out</hi> after the Woman, who was there as yet upon <hi>the Eagles wings,</hi> they are as fitly typified by the <hi>waters of a flood;</hi> for <hi>floods</hi> come down from thence.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:38410:129"/>down like common Rain, but vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deſcending from above; as if the Windows of the Heavens which once were opened to the Deluge of the World, were now once more ſet open to the overflowing of the Church.

               <p>How can it then be thought that the Roman Clergy, that did the Woman ſo much ſervice in her former perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her <hi>Heavenly</hi> State, where they are typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels,</hi> ſhould be here unconcern'd in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſecution, where the Woman is aſſaulted with ſuch kind of Enemies, as are moſt fit to be encountred by her Clergy? It is therefore certain that her Clergy had the greateſt hand in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her off at this time alſo. And who but they ſhould here be typified by the Earth, it is not eaſie to conceive. Nay we cannot reaſonably ſuſpect the truth of it, if we admit of that Hypotheſis, which hath been proved from the Angels interpretation of the <hi>Viſion, Rev.</hi> xvii, where we are told, that by the Woman is meant the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Hypotheſis the <hi>great red Dragon</hi> with ſeven Heads crowned, will typify (as hath been ſhewn already) the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors: and the <hi>two Wings of the great Eagle</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. Whence it will follow of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:38410:130"/>ſity that the <hi>Woman</hi> born upon thoſe Wings, muſt ſignify the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of her Chriſtian Emperors, before thoſe Wings were broken, and <hi>the ten Horns, together with the Beaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Power as Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ſo, let us but conſult the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of thoſe times, and we ſhall find, that as they ſpeak of nothing that can be more lively repreſented by the <hi>Waters</hi> poured out of the Serpent's mouth, than that mighty Inundation of Hereticks, which were the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Peſt of this Period: ſo we ſhall find the <hi>Clergie</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and nothing elſe but them, ſo far as that particular Church is here concerned) to anſwer punctually to every thing that is here ſpoken of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As, 1. it is here ſaid, That <hi>the Earth helped the Woman:</hi> ſo did they the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. It is ſaid, That <hi>the Earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up the ſtood which the Dragon caſt out of his mouth.</hi> And ſo did they, by <hi>opening of their mouths,</hi> and judging and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:38410:131"/>the Controverſies of Religion, which were ſtarted in thoſe Times, and by maintaining the Cauſe, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſons of the Orthodox, appeaſe thoſe Tumults, and confound thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and were the moſt obſervable and renowned <hi>Helpers,</hi> not only of their own particular, but of the Univerſal Church. Theſe therefore helped the Woman by ſuch-like means as the Hereticks perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted her. For as they perſecuted her, <hi>by pouring out of their mouth a flood of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> ſo theſe <hi>helped her, by opening of their mouths,</hi> and ſwallowing up the flood. And it is but fit that what Heretical Teachers labour to deſtroy with their mouths, the Orthodox ſhould as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endeavour to preſerve with theirs.</p>
               <p>There remains then but one thing more to be accounted for concerning this Type, <hi>viz.</hi> Why the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> though they ſtill continue Orthodox in the Faith, and faithful <hi>Helpers</hi> of the Woman in her Perſecutions and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the Goſpel's ſake, ſhould yet
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:38410:131"/>be typified by the <hi>Earth?</hi> Eſpecially ſince the <hi>Woman</hi> herſelf is hitherto upon the <hi>Eagle's wings.</hi> For, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, <hi>the Earth</hi> is uſed in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy as a moſt diſhonourable Type, to repreſent the moſt depraved &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate of things. And therefore it may ſeem a very improper repreſentation of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> who at this time were Orthodox. Neither can it, be thought that this Type is given them without ſome reaſon: or that it fell to them by chance, or that becauſe the <hi>Hereticks</hi> are repreſented by <hi>a flood, the Orthodox</hi> are typified by <hi>the Earth</hi> of courſe, and for the due proportion of the Allegory.</p>
               <p>But let us not be ſo vain as to imagin that the Spirit of Prophecy could not have invented five hundred other Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories to expreſs theſe paſſages by, moſt punctually and exactly, if this had fail'd in any circumſtance. Since therefore it is obſervable <hi>that the Earth</hi> doth alwayes ſignify a <hi>degenerate</hi> ſtate of things, it is not to be doubted but the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> who are here typified by the <hi>Earth,</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:38410:132"/>though they were orthodox in the Faith, yet were ſufficiently degenerate in ſome other matter. And what that matter was is very manifeſt from the Hiſtories of thoſe times, who joyntly tell us that the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> being mightily enriched under their Chriſtian Emperours, did withal degenerate to Earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are very obſervable in all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories for their covetous and ambitious practices.</p>
               <p>And yet there may another reaſon be given, why the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> in this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice which they did the Woman, are here typified by the <hi>Earth.</hi> For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are conveniently repreſented under the <hi>Wings</hi> (as it were) of thoſe Chriſtian Emperours, by whoſe favour protection, and encouragement, they were ſo ſuccesful in this undertaking.</p>
               <p>And thus we have the Woman's <hi>Airy</hi> ſtate, or, the deſcription of her flight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs. For that which follows in the 17th verſe, is but a Preface to her <hi>Earthly-Wilderneſs</hi>-condition. But here it is well worthy to be obſerved, that upon
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:38410:132"/>the ſuppoſition of the truth of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we have an undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Orthodox Faith profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> throughout this Period, againſt the Hereticks that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it; and particularly againſt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who of all others were the buſieſt at this time. For it is manifeſt, that thoſe prevailing Doctrines, by whoſe Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was perſecuted, and which were <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> by the Earth (that is, which were condemn'd and ſilenc'd) in this Period, ſo that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they were little heard of in the Church, were Hereſies, or (in the language of this Prophecy) <hi>the flood which the Dragon caſt out of his mouth.</hi> And it is obſervable peculiarly of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, that although in this Period it made ſo great a buſtle in the Church, and prevail'd almoſt to the ſubverſion of the true Faith: Yet in a little time it was ſo far baffled by the Zeal and Vigour of the Orthodox, and deſerted by its own Profeſſors, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the next Period
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:38410:133"/>(when the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> came to be deſtroyed, and the Church arrived at her <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate) we find in Hiſtory very little of it; and ſoon after, nothing. For indeed almoſt all Sects &amp; Hereſies of the former times were ſwallowed up in that third Period, in the Antichriſtian Pride &amp; Greatneſs, and Idolatries of the Church of Rome. And it is yet far more evident, that the Orthodox Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ever bleſſed Trinity cannot be interpreted to be any of that <hi>flood,</hi> which the <hi>Dragon caſt out of his mouth:</hi> becauſe this was ſo far from being <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up</hi> in this Period, that it has ever ſince continued for above theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years moſt zealouſly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally profeſſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But here alſo let us obſerve, that that <hi>Wo</hi> which at the firſt ſhifting of the Scene we find denounced againſt <hi>the Inhabiters of the Earth, and of the Sea,</hi> is now in part already come upon them. For though the Woman be yet perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, &amp; her Clergy Orthodox: yet is ſhe herſelf declining, and her Clergy waxen
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:38410:133"/>Earthy, and the Waters round about her dangerouſly infected with the poyſon of Heretical Opinions.</p>
               <p>But from henceforth expect no more to ſee the Woman perſecuted. For the Dragon having in theſe two attempts perceiv'd himſelf unable to effect his ends upon her by any ſort of Perſecution, is now about to try his artifice in deceiving her; and ſo prevails by this device that of a perſecuted and afflicted Woman, he makes her <hi>drunken with the blood of Saints,</hi> and thoſe, her own children too, a few, <hi>a remnant of her</hi> righteous <hi>Seed.</hi> For ſo it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 17. That <hi>the Dragon</hi> (upon this ſecond unſuccesfulneſs of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Woman) <hi>was wroth with her, and went to make war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her ſeed, which keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Dragon</hi> being <hi>wroth with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> for having been too hard for him in thoſe two attempts that he had lately made upon her by way of perſecution, is now about to try another courſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:38410:134"/>to deceive her; &amp; <hi>to make war,</hi> not any more <hi>with her,</hi> but with <hi>the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her ſeed.</hi> For of this I muſt deſire the Reader to take ſpecial notice, That ſo ſoon as <hi>the Woman</hi> is <hi>fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs upon the Eagles Wings,</hi> (that is, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ceaſed to be governed by a pair of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and the <hi>ten Horns</hi> came to <hi>receive power as Kings,</hi> as we ſee in the very beginning of the next Perſecution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii, it being that <hi>war</hi> for which the <hi>Dragon</hi> is now preparing) <hi>the Woman,</hi> that is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, (as that word <hi>Catholick</hi> ſignifies the Generality of her Profeſſours) ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be perſecuted, as ſhe had been all along before, &amp; becomes the Dragon's friend: who through his kindneſs to her in ſetting her upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii, did eaſily perſwade her to prevaricate in her Faith with God, to turn a great Idolatreſs, &amp; to drink large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the blood of Saints.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I muſt needs impute it to ſome fatal inſtinct, that they of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:38410:134"/>of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally profeſſed among them, have bin ſo very fond of this ill-boding name of <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> For though this name were very honorable in the primitive times, and gave place to none even in the next declining Period, (for hitherto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had laboured under Perſecutions) Yet when ſhe once is come into the Wilderneſs, we find this Woman ſo aſtoniſhingly altered, that the name of <hi>Heathen</hi> is not more abominable than the name of <hi>Roman-Catholick.</hi> We need not therefore envy our preſent <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> the honour which they challenge as peculiar to themſelves, of being <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick:</hi> if, by our piety &amp; ſencere preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, we can but approve our ſelves to be of that holy <hi>remnant of her Off-ſpring,</hi>whom ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes for not conſenting with her, but reproving her Idolatries; that is, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true Proteſtants in keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, <hi>and having the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo ſad a ſtory for poor Roman
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:38410:135"/>Catholicks, that I profeſs I am exceeding ſorry for them. But yet I ſee not any poſſibility of finding out a milder ſenſe, or a more favourable conſtruction of this Prophecy for them, without making the moſt incoherent non-ſenſe of it in the world. For in the xvii <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> we have <hi>the Woman</hi> deſcribed in her <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-condition. And there the Angel has ſo plainly told us, that by the Woman is meant the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that even <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, and many other the moſt celebrated Champions of the Roman Church, are forc'd to own it. But now that <hi>Woman</hi> in the Wilderneſs muſt be the ſame with this which <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs;</hi> &amp; ſhe which <hi>fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs,</hi> is the ſame with her who before <hi>was cloathed with the Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars,</hi> who was perſecuted by the <hi>Dragon</hi> both then, and in the time of her flying into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: ſo that 'tis impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this <hi>Woman</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt within that City.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:38410:135"/>
               <p>Neither will any <hi>Romanist</hi> find fault with me for ſpeaking ſo very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as I have done throughout the firſt Period, which repreſents her <hi>Clergie,</hi> by the glorious Type of <hi>Michael and his Angels;</hi> nor will they blame me for that ſingular commendation of their Orthodoxy in the ſecond Period, while the <hi>Woman</hi> was <hi>flying into the Wilderneſs</hi> upon thoſe <hi>two Wings</hi> of the <hi>great Eagle:</hi> now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt bear with me, while I ſpeak no worſe things, nor no other of her, after ſhe is come into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> than what the Holy Spirit of Prophecy has in plain words declared and foretold concerning her.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſhe is not yet arrived at her <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>-condition. And let them then that are of this opinion ſhew us who is meant by that <hi>great red Dragon</hi> with <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> crowned, &amp; <hi>ten Horns</hi> uncrowned. Let them ſhew us plainly when that <hi>perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let them ſhew us who that Man-child was whom the <hi>Woman brought forth,</hi> and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:38410:136"/>who <hi>was caught up to the Throne of God.</hi> Let them us give a clear account of that <hi>War</hi> which was between <hi>Michael and his Angels</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Dragon and his Angels</hi> on the other ſide: wherein the <hi>Dragon</hi> is ſaid to <hi>have been caſt out to the Earth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Michael and his Angels</hi> to have overcome him <hi>by the Blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony, and becauſe they loved not their lives unto the death.</hi> And let them further make it plain to us, what is meant by thoſe <hi>two wings</hi> of the great <hi>Eagle,</hi> that were given to the <hi>Woman</hi> for the expediting of her flight into the Wilderneſs: and let them clear thoſe other circumſtances of the <hi>ſecond Period.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſhe is come into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> is repreſented there as ſitting upon <hi>Peoples,</hi> and <hi>Multitudes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> or otherwiſe, as ſitting upon the <hi>Romas</hi> Beaſt, or Kingdom under the ſeventh Head, or eighth King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is there ſaid to have been given to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to have made all Nations drunk with

               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:38410:138"/>
               <p>For let me add, that we who have departed from the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (or, if you pleaſe, are driven out from her Communion) are not ſo unconcern'd in this Prophecy, as we generally would make our ſelves believe we are. Inſomuch that many good and learned Men amongſt us have ſeemed a little to diſcourage all attempts of looking into theſe myſterious ſecrets of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and even to take a little pride in owning that they are not wiſe enough to comprehend them. From whence this miſchief has enſued, that the unfolding of them has bin moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left either to factious, or to injudicious perſons, who being carried away with violent prejudices, or not having abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities anſwerable to their Zeal of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Truth, have made but very little progreſs in the work.</p>
               <p>But, I ſay, the Proteſtant Churches are not altogether unconcerned in this Propheſie. For as we have a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if ſhe be come into the <hi>Wilderneſs:</hi> ſo if ſhe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:38410:138"/>ſtill continue in her <hi>Heavenly</hi> ſtate, or be as yet but on the <hi>Eagle's wings,</hi> I cannot ſee how we that ſeparate from her Communion, can be juſtified in ſo doing. For if this <hi>Woman</hi> be the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which I take to be one of the moſt demonſtrable Truths that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this, or any other Prophecy) let us but read thoſe paſſages that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern either her <hi>Heavenly</hi> or her <hi>declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſtate, and we muſt needs perceive even from the letter of the Text, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of any Expoſition, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For then we have the Spirit evidently bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs together with us, that ſhe is a great Idolatreſs, and a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Perſecutrix of the Saints, that is, of that ſmall <hi>remnant of her Seed,</hi> whom God hath reſerved to himſelf out of that general Defection and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, which at that time was to befil the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

                  </hi> in general, and the <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Remnant of her Seed,</hi> are three diſtinct and ſeveral things. Now in both the former Periock, the Dragon had perſecuted the Womans her ſelf, and all her Seed in general, that perſiſted in communion with her. But now that ſhe is come into the Wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be fed and nouriſhed <hi>from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Who then can be this <hi>Reminant of her Seed?</hi> Firſt, it is evident that by the <hi>Remnant of her Seed,</hi> cannot be meant the <hi>Woman</hi> herſelf, for ſhe muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be diſtinguiſhed from her <hi>Seed,</hi> much rather from the <hi>Remnant of her ſeed.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we find the Woman, after ſhe is come into the Wilderneſs, not perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſo far from that, that ſhe is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aking War herſelf againſt the Saints, and drunken with the blood of them.</p>
               <p>Neither can we underſtand by this <hi>remnant of her Seed, her Seed in general,</hi> namely thoſe <hi>her Younger Children,</hi> which ſhe was to be delivered of in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in oppoſition of <hi>that elder Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring</hi> which ſhe had brought forth in the two former Periods. For, as for the generality of her Children, after ſhe is come into the Wilderneſs, they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declared to have run with her to the ſame exceſs of riot and impiety. For how can a more Catholick Apoſtacy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:38410:140"/>be deſcribed, than that whereof this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was to be the Author in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, with whom it is ſaid, That the
<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. xvii. 2. &amp; xviii. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Kings of the Earth have committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and the Inhabiters of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication; and that all nations had drunk of it.</hi> Wherfore this <hi>Remnant of her Seed,</hi> cannot be ſpoken of the <hi>Generality of her Seed</hi> that ſhe was to bring forth in the Wilderneſs, becauſe they generally took part with her in her Impieties: Whereas it is ſaid of this <hi>Remnant of her Seed,</hi> with whom the Dragon is now preparing to make War, that they are ſuch as <hi>keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that by this <hi>Remnant of the Woman's Seed,</hi> ſhould be <hi>a few of her Children,</hi> that ſhe ſhould bring forth in the Wilderneſs, who through the ſpecial Grace of God ſhould be preſerved pure from her corruptions; in oppoſition to thoſe <hi>many,</hi> or if you pleaſe, that <hi>Catholick party</hi> of her Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:38410:140"/>who ſhould hold Communion with her.</p>
               <p>And this is the conſtant ſence of this word <hi>Remnant</hi> throughout the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where it very frequently occurrs.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 2 King. xix. 4, 31. Nehem. i. 3. <hi>And there are many other Texts to like purpoſe.</hi>
                  </note> For there, when any general Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Calamity is deſcribed, thoſe whom it pleaſeth God to ſave out of it, are very ſeldom otherwiſe expreſſed, than by a <hi>Remnant,</hi> or a <hi>Reſidue,</hi> or ſome word of like importance.</p>
               <p>When therefore it is ſaid that the <hi>Dragon was wroth with the Woman,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning is, that he was wroth with her, as having miſt his deſigne upon her in two ſeveral Perſecutions of two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts; the one by making War with her, when he had the State his friend, as in the time of the Heathen Emperours: the other by a flood of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſies, in the next ſucceeding Period, when the State was turned to the Churches ſide, and therefore would not help the Dragon to make War againſt
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:38410:141"/>her. But the Woman makes a ſhift to eſcape ſafe into the Wilderneſs out of both theſe Perſecutions: and this is that which makes the Dragon angry with her. But how does he revenge himſelf upon her? He does not <hi>make War</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Her,</hi> becauſe the State continues friendly to her ſtill. Neither does he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute her by <hi>Hereſie:</hi> for he had found the unſuccesfulneſs of that but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He therefore now intends to cozen her with a falſe Religion: not ſuch as ſhall be manifeſtly impious, like the Hereſies of the former Period: but ſuch as ſhall have in it a great ſhew of Piety and Devotion.</p>
               <p>And finding the inclinations of her Clergy, that they were ſet on worldly things, he feeds their covetous and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious humor, and thereby betraies them into thoſe miſchiefs and impieties, for which we find the Woman ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reprehended in the following Period. So the Dragon having thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with a ſhew of Piety, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiated himſelf with her by promoting
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:38410:141"/>her worldly intereſt and advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news his firſt attempt of making Warr even by the means of this deluded Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man herſelf, againſt that pious <hi>Remnaut of her Seed,</hi> who keep <hi>the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus he makes the Woman much more miſerable by his flatteries and deluſions, than 'ere he could have done by violence and an open enmity.</p>
               <p>Hence we may gather, that in the next Period, to wit, that of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's <hi>Earthy</hi> ſtate, or abode in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, we ſhall meet with two ſorts of Churches, an Apoſtatical or Idolatrous, and an Apoſtolical or pure Church. The Catholick Church is the Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Idolatrous, the <hi>Remnant of her Seed</hi> Apoſtolically pure. And of this latter Church the Saints in general are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God:</hi> and the Clergy ſuch as have <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, of the Saints in general, who are ſaid to <hi>keep the Commandments of God:</hi> which phraſe of <hi>keeping the Commadments
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:38410:142"/>of God,</hi> is to be underſtood with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reſpect to the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which forbids <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And the meaning is, that whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, ſhould Apoſtatize to Idolatry: this <hi>Remuant of her Seed</hi> ſhould continue in the pure &amp; uncorrupt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the only living and true God, according to the Rule of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To this purpoſe, it is obſervable that in the ſecond Commandment, the reaſon annexed to the prohibition of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> is the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of God, who will puniſh the iniquities of them that hate him; but will ſhew mercy to them that love him and <hi>keep his Commandments.</hi> Which reaſons being annexed peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſecond Commandment, there is no doubt but God thereby intended to declare what a great account he makes of the obſervance, or the non-obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it. Inſomuch that he makes this Commandment a kind of teſt of our affection towards him; but eſteeming of the <hi>Breakers</hi> of it, as if they <hi>hated</hi> him, but of the <hi>Obſervers</hi> of it, as of thoſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:38410:142"/>that <hi>love him, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As if thoſe that violated this one Commandment, had quite ſhaken off all duty and obedience towards God: but the Obſervers of it were his faithfull Servants, though poſſible in ſome other matters they might have their failings.</p>
               <p>And it may not be unworthy to be obſerved, that the Spirit of Prophecy deſcribing the Saints here with reſpect to the ſtate of Chriſts Church <hi>in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> may very well be thought to allude to that particular notion of <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandments of God,</hi> wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth it to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> And that not only in the ſecond Commandment, (but agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto) in many other paſſages of his Writings. As may be ſeen in <hi>Deut.</hi> vii, viii, &amp;c. And in all thoſe Places, not a few, where the <hi>Keeping and Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant of God,</hi> (which <hi>Covenant</hi> are his <hi>Commnadments</hi>) are uſed with a particular Reſpect to the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. It being very rarely found that any Commandment is particularly
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:38410:143"/>mentioned, and ſingled out from among the reſt, but either it is the ſecond Commandment only, or the ſecond Commandment is one of them.</p>
               <p>And this is the more obſervable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> turned to Idolatry, ſo was the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church to do alſo. And therefore it is very likely, that as God in preſſing his Commandments upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> layes a Special Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for the Obſervation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment: ſo in commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this holy <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Chriſtian Churches Seed in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> for <hi>keeping his Commandments,</hi> he has a particular Reſpect to that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in breaking whereof the grand Apoſtacy of the Catholick Church ſhould be moſt viſible and notorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. As for the <hi>Clergy</hi> of this ſmall, contemptible, and perſecuted, but yet pure Church of Chriſt, they are ſaid to be ſuch as <hi>have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, who <hi>teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of God,</hi> exhorting to keep the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:38410:143"/>Commandments of God, and denounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Judgments againſt the Deſpiſers of them. And here alſo there ſeems to be an alluſion to <hi>Moſes's teſtifying</hi> in the Wilderneſs againſt the Church of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> viii. 19.

               <p>And it is further more obſervable that theſe perſons, who are here ſaid to <hi>have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are the ſame that in the foregoing Chapter (<hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 3, 6, 7, 10.) are called <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and their office is deſcribed to be <hi>propheſying,</hi> and reproving the corruptious of the times they lived in, and bearing <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The time agrees exactly to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. For the Dragon went to make War with thoſe that <hi>have the Testimony of Jeſus Christ,</hi> at the time of the Woman's getting into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that is, at the beginning of the Apoſtatical and Idolatrous Times of the Church, when the Church, which is the City of God, began to be prophaned with Falſe Worſhip.

               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Now that theſe Angels are the two Witneſſes, I prove by fourteen of them
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:38410:146"/>Seven that ſound the ſeven Trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> viii, ix, xi; and ſeven that pour out the ſeven Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvi. For of the two Witneſſes it is ſaid (Rev. xi. 6.) <hi>that they have Power over Waters, to turn them into Blood, and to ſmite the Earth with all Plagues as often as they will.</hi> Which agrees moſt exactly with the office of thoſe Angels that ſound the Trumpets, and pour out the Vials: for they do nothing elſe with their Vials, and their Trumpets, but ſmite the Earth with <hi>Plagues,</hi> and <hi>turn the Waters into Blood.</hi> Theſe Angels then having the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and being the two Witneſſes: it follows that they which have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, are the two Witneſſes. And that they are all of them Miniſters of the Goſpel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, not only from their Teſtifying, which is the proper Act of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Function; but in that it was the Prieſt's Office to blow with the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>Joſh.</hi> vi. 4, to which the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with ſeven Trumpets are a plain Alluſion; and in that thoſe ſeven Angels,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38410:147"/>which pour out the Vials of God's wrath, (to turn the Waters into Blood and ſmite the Earth with Plagues) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Chap.</hi> xv. 6. as coming out of the <hi>Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> (whither none but the Prieſts might enter) <hi>cloathed with pure and white Linnen</hi> (which was the Prieſtly Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) and <hi>having their Breaſts girded with Golden Girdles</hi> (the Prieſtly Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.)</p>
               <p>Hence therefore we may certainly conclude, ſo far as any light can be had from comparing the Circumſtances of this Prophecy, That the <hi>two Witneſſes Rev.</hi> xi, are the ſame with theſe that are of the <hi>Remnant of the Woman's Seed, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is therefore a meer fancy of <hi>Bellarmin's,</hi> and without any ſolid foundation in this Prophecy, that <hi>the two Witneſſes</hi> are <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſhall come in their Bodies to propheſie againſt Antichriſt. For how can theſe be ſaid to be of the <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Chriſtian Churches ſeed? And thus much of the Expoſition of the ſecond Period.</p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:38410:147"/>
               <p>Now according to this Expoſition, I ſhall ſubjoyn this following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. — Wo to the Inhabiters of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Nations ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, (which from henceforth for your degeneracy may well be likened to <hi>the Inhabiters of the Earth, and of the Sea,</hi> in compariſon of that <hi>Heavenly</hi> purity of your Fathers of the firſt Period:) for the Devil being vanquiſhed by thoſe Primitive Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, is come down to you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great Wrath, as being ſenſible that he hath but a ſhort time to deceive the World in, in reſpect of thoſe thouſands of years which he hath ſpent in that work already.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And when Satan ſaw that he was overcome by thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, he perſecuted the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that had gotten a Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And in this Period the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:38410:148"/>(whoſe Banner is an <hi>Eagle</hi>) came to be divided into two Empires, and to be governed by a pair of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; whoſe Favour proved prejudicial to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For in their time, enjoying Reſt from Heathen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and great affluence of worldly Wealth and Honour, She began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Superſtition; and thoſe good Emperours ſerved her only as <hi>two Wings of a great Eagle</hi> to bear Her down from Her Primitive ſtate of <hi>Heavenly</hi> Purity, to a Degenerate, and <hi>Earthly</hi> ſtate; or (which is all one) to expedite her Flight from Her <hi>Egyptian</hi> Perſecutors, under whom ſhe lived a moſt pure and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life, into ſuch a ſtate of Eaſe, and Safety, free and quiet Exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> enjoyed in the <hi>Wilderneſs:</hi> for this is that State of things to which ſhe is now haſting, and in which ſhe is to be nouriſhed with ſuch things as her Soul luſteth after, for the ſpace of three years (of years) and an half, that is, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and threeſcore years,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:38410:148"/>from the open violence and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil</p>
               <p n="15">15. And that old Serpent, ſeeing that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo well guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Power and favour of her Chriſtian Emperous, could not make War againſt her as before, but raiſed up a great abundance of <hi>Hereticks</hi> againſt her on every ſide, which for their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, their Impetuouſneſs, and the Poyſon, and Malignity of their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, may be compared to a <hi>Flood of Water caſt out of the Serpent's mouth</hi> after her, that he might cauſe her to be <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away</hi> with it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But this Flood being poured out after the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was as yet upon the Eagles Wings, did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſcend unto the <hi>Earth,</hi> that is, the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who were faln ſooner to the Earth then the Church her ſelf; who being Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, Covetous, and Ambitious, but yet continuing Orthodox in the Faith, did help the Church, and by their wiſe, Judicious management of thoſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:38410:149"/>in Religion, and Authoritative Deciſion and Condemnation of them, did (as it were) <hi>ſwallow up</hi> this Flood, that the Serpent had caſt out of his Mouth, and quell the Tumults he had ſtirred up againſt their Church.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And the Serpent being thus a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time defeated in his Project, was wroth with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and intending to make another Experiment upon her, by deceiving her, and her Children into Superſtition and Idolatry, under a fair ſhew of Kindneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Piety, went to make War with <hi>the Remnant of her Seed,</hi> whom God ſhould mercifully preſerve from that Catholick Defection, who <hi>keep the Commandments of God,</hi> perſiſting in his Pure Worſhip, and have the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> teaching all men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Commandmens of God, and warning thoſe Apoſtate-Gentile-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to abſtain from Idols.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the ſecond Period, which gives us an account of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Aiery or declining ſtate. We come
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:38410:149"/>now to the third and laſt Period, which concerns her Earthly, Eremitical, or Degenerate State.</p>

               </p>
               <p>WE have followed <hi>the Woman</hi> into <hi>the Wilderneſs,</hi> let us now ſee what becomes of her there; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of her <hi>Clergy,</hi> who in the firſt Period were typified by <hi>Michael and his Angels;</hi> in the ſecond, by the <hi>Earth:</hi> what becomes of the <hi>Civil State</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whoſe <hi>Emperors</hi> in the firſt Period were typified by <hi>the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, an Adverſary;</hi> and in the ſecond by <hi>two Wings of a great Eygle,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a <hi>Friend</hi> to the Woman, being ſaid to have bin <hi>given</hi> to her: and laſtly, how, and by what means the Dragon manages that War, which, upon his defeat in the ſecond Period, he went to make with that holy <hi>Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of the Woman's <hi>Seed,</hi> which keep the Commandments of God. and have ths Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Of all theſe things we have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account in the xviith and xiiith
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:38410:150"/>Chapters. Where the Woman is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as a great Idolatreſs and a cruel Perſecutrix of the Saints; her Clergy ſitting at the Helm of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and having ſupream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therein, by the favour of thoſe ten Kings among whom that Empire came to be divided at the Woman's entering into the Wilderneſs; and by the means of theſe ten Kings, headed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, the <hi>Dragon</hi> went to <hi>make</hi> that <hi>War</hi> againſt that <hi>Remnant</hi> of the Woman's Seed. For of theſe ten Kings the Angel tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 14. <hi>that they ſhould make War with the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, that they ſhould make War with him in his Saints.</p>
               <p>And this is expreſſed more clearly of theſe ten Kings, who being united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Headſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, are called <hi>the Beaſt that roſe up out of the Sea,</hi> Rev. xiii. 1. of whom it is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 7. that it was <hi>given unto him to make War with the Saints,</hi> that is, with thoſe that <hi>keep the Commandments of God,</hi> and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:38410:151"/>
                  <hi>have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that this War was made with them by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as the principal Author of it, appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 2. where it is ſaid of this Beaſt, the more immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of it, that <hi>the Dragon gave him his Power and Seat and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> Now therefore come we to the particular Explication of this xiii. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Which xiiith Chapter containes a Deſcription of two Beaſts; the one ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned; the other two-horned. Of the ten-horned Beaſt, we have an account from <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. to <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. in theſe words.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>And I ſtood upon the Sand of the Sea, and ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blaſphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his Feet were as the Feet of a Bear, and his Mouth as the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:38410:151"/>Mouth of a Lion: and the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And I ſaw one of his Heads, as it were wounded to Death; and his deadly Wound was healed: and all the World wondred after the Beaſt.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>And it was given unto Him to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them: and Power was given him over all Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</hi>

               <p>This ten-horned Beaſt which is here deſcribed in theſe ten Verſes, is the ſame with that whereof the Angel tells us in the ſeventeenth Chapter. For there (as hath bin ſaid) he is foretold of under his laſt Head, together with whom the ten Horns were to receive Power as Kings. In token of which they are here repreſented with <hi>ten Crowns</hi> upon them.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:38410:152"/>but together with the ſeventh Head they were to <hi>receive Power as Kings;</hi> and therefore under this ſeventh Head (i. e. the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop) is this ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed and ten-horned Beaſt exhibited in the Chapter we have now to deal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>timate to us, that from the Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, (the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours being <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Wings,</hi> which when broken off, the <hi>other</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable) We are to compute the Reign of the laſt King or Head of the blaſphemous Beaſt. And that is, from about the Year four Hundred fifty ſix, as I conceive, but let the Reader uſe his own Judgment.</p>
               <p>Thus then one Wing being broken off; and conſequently the other not being able of it ſelf to bear the Woman up above the ground, we muſt imagin
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:38410:153"/>that the <hi>great Eagle,</hi> which received her out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> has fairly now by this time ſet her down upon <hi>the Earth.</hi> And in this Poſture, the Woman ſitting on the Earth upon <hi>ſeven Mountains;</hi> and <hi>the Peoples, Nations, Multitudes, and Tongues</hi> belonging to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, being circumfus'd like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters round about her, we muſt conceive the Viſion to be now preſented to <hi>St. John.</hi> And thus we have thoſe <hi>Inhabiters of the Earth and of the Sea</hi> compleated, againſt whom that <hi>Wo</hi> was predenounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 12, as hath been ſhewed before upon the Place: for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>the Woman</hi> herſelf ſitting upon <hi>ſeven Mountains,</hi> are the <hi>Inhabiters of the Earth;</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, <hi>the Inhabiters of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. John</hi> then, ſtanding upon the Sand (or ſhore) of the Sea, in a place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Proſpect to behold the Riſe of theſe two Beaſts deſcribed in this xiiith Chapter, obſerves one of them (<hi>viz.</hi> the ten-horned) to ariſe up out of the <hi>Sea.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:38410:153"/>Ver.</hi> 1. and the other (<hi>Viz.</hi> the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned) to come up out of <hi>the Earth, ver.</hi> 11. The meaning of which is plainly this; That he ſaw the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which before was governed by a pair of Emperours, divided now into ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, ten Kings ariſing in the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, and that he ſaw another King ariſing out of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. Of which other King it is ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. that <hi>he had two Horns like the Lamb's, but that he ſpake like the Dragon;</hi> and alſo <hi>that be exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt</hi> (ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorned) <hi>Beaſt before him.</hi> By which words, as it is plainly ſignified, that this latter King ſhould reign altogether with the former; ſo it is not obſcurely hinted to us, that though he carried on <hi>the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon's</hi> work, yet ſhould he hold ſome near Reſemblance outwardly to the <hi>Lamb</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. Which exactly agrees with that which hath bin ſhewed before out of the xviith Chapter, where <hi>the Biſhops of Rome</hi> have the ill hap to fall out to be <hi>the laſt Head</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of that <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaded</hi> and <hi>ten-horned Beaſt.</hi> To whom
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:38410:154"/>alſo <hi>the ten Horns</hi> were to <hi>give their Power, and Strength and Kingdom, Rev.</hi> xvii. 13, 17. according as it is here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily ſaid of this two-horned Beaſt to like purpoſe, That <hi>he exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt</hi> (ten-horned) <hi>Beaſt.</hi> By which is ſignified that this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt ſhould be the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Prim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In this third Period then there wat to be two Supream Lords in each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in all; and each of the ten Kings in his reſpective Kingdom. And though this might ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that have not ſeen the things that we have ſeen: yet now the Romaniſts have made it out ſo clearly to us, that there are few but can unriddle it. For each of the ten Kings within his own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:38410:154"/>is Supream in meerly <hi>Temporal</hi> Affairs: and the <hi>King</hi> that has <hi>two Horns like the Lamb,</hi> in <hi>Spirituals;</hi> yea, and in <hi>Temporals too, in ordine ad Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi> ſo far as <hi>Spirituals</hi> things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven, and concern'd in <hi>Temporals.</hi> And this is the Reaſon that we have now two Beaſts or Kings deſcribed in this Period: the firſt whereof (<hi>viz.</hi> the ten-horned) we may call the <hi>Secular</hi> leaſt; and the other (if you pleaſe) the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the buſineſs of Religion, (which is the principal concern of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) there is in effect but one Beaſt: ſince it is ſaid of the <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt, that <hi>be exerciſeth all the Power</hi> (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is <hi>the Head</hi>) of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Secular Beaſt.</p>
               <p>But if the xiiith and xviith Chapters, ſet forth the ſame Beaſt to us (as was ſaid before) how comes it to paſs, that we find <hi>a Woman</hi> ſitting upon the Beaſt in <hi>Chap.</hi> xviith, but none in the xiiith?

               <p>And to this purpoſe it is further yet obſervable, that <hi>St. John</hi> had ſeen the Viſion of the xviith <hi>Chapter</hi> before.

And where can that more probably be thought to have bin done than in this thirteenth Chapter? And we ſhall make but little Queſtion of it, if we conſider, That the Angel in <hi>Chap.</hi> xvii, having called <hi>St. John</hi> to ſee <hi>the Judgment of the great Whore that ſitteth upon many Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> ſhews him <hi>a Woman ſitting on a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-headed and ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> viz. the Beaſt deſcribed in this xiii Chapter, which he had ſeen to have riſen <hi>out of the Sea.</hi> This Viſion therefore of the xiiith Chapter is in effect the ſame with that of the xvii. And as it is there ſaid, at <hi>ver.</hi> 3, that the Beaſt was <hi>full of names of Blaſphemy:</hi> ſo here at <hi>ver.</hi> 1, he is ſaid to have had <hi>upon his Heads a Name of Blaſphemy,</hi> and a little after, to have <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the great queſtion here will be, what Kind of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is here ſpoken of? I anſwer; It is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For no other Sort of Blaſphemy has bin common to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:38410:156"/>
                  <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> of the Beaſt, but this. To which we may add, That the great fault of theſe ten Kings is ſaid, in ſeveral Places of the Revelation, to be Idolatry. As <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 2. <hi>With whom</hi> the Kings <hi>of the Earth have committed Fornication,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. 3. For <hi>all</hi> Nations <hi>have drunk of the Wine of the Wrath of Her</hi> Fornication, <hi>and the</hi> Kings <hi>of the Earth have committed</hi> Fornication <hi>with Her,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſame again at <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>The</hi> Kings <hi>of the Earth, who have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Fornication <hi>with her,</hi> &amp;c. So alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> xiv. 8. <hi>Babyton is faln, becauſe ſhe made</hi> all Nations <hi>drink of the Wine of the Wrath of her</hi> Fornication. Nor can I find any other <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> laid to the Charge of theſe <hi>Kings,</hi> or theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> throughout the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but only that of Spiritual Fornication, or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Certainly, if they had bin guilty of any other <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> we ſhould have had ſome mention of it, in ſome or one of thoſe many Places, where the Spirit ſeems on purpoſe to draw up his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment againſt that <hi>Great Babylon,</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:38410:156"/>and the <hi>Nations</hi> that were in League with Her, to ſhew the equity of the Judgments which God had purpoſed to inflict upon them. And on the other ſide, if by this their <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in this xiiith Chapter, were not meant <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> how ſhould it come to paſs that we ſhould have no mention here of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> where the Spirit ſeems on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to characterize their Apoſtacy. For it is evident from this xiiith Chapter, that the great Apoſtacy of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould conſiſt in Blaſphemy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all the other paſſages of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, it is expreſt by <hi>Fornication</hi> or Idolatry. Till therefore it can manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved, that the Spirit hath any where charged them with ſome other ſort of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> we muſt expound this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of the xiiith <hi>Chapter</hi> to be meant of their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And it is moſt unqueſtionable, that the Notion of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is generally taken in ſo large a ſenſe in <hi>Scripture</hi> that it will eaſily admit of this Interpretation we have given of it.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:38410:157"/>
               <p>Laſtly, it will be no hard Matter to demonſtrate what were the very Words and Syllables of that <hi>Name of Blaſphemy</hi> which were written on the <hi>laſt Head</hi> of this <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Beaſt. For under his laſt Head He is ſet forth to us both in this xiiith <hi>Chapter,</hi> and in the xviith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Now in the xviith-<hi>Chapter,</hi> the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſitting upon the <hi>Beaſt</hi> under his laſt Head, is ſaid to have had upon Her <hi>Fore-Head a Name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,</hi> &amp;c. This is the Name which was ſeen upon the laſt Head of this ten-horned <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For the Head of the <hi>Woman</hi> and the Head of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> are all one: The ſame King being ſupream both in the <hi>Woman,</hi> and the <hi>Beast;</hi> that is, both in the <hi>Imperial City,</hi> the <hi>Territories</hi> of the Empire. But now if this were the <hi>Name of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> that was ſeen upon the <hi>Beaſt's</hi> Head, it is certain that his <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> was Idolatry.</p>
               <p>And further from this <hi>Name of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> may partly be demonſtrated <hi>what
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:38410:157"/>kind of Idol-Worſhip</hi> this Beaſt ſhould Patronize. For ſince the firſt Word of his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>MYSTERY,</hi> methinks here ſhould be ſome thing more intended by it, than only to let us know that his <hi>Metropolis</hi> ſhould be not the <hi>Literal,</hi> but a <hi>Myſtical Babylon;</hi> and his <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Spiritual:</hi> for there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances of the Prophecy which evince this clearly. I ſuppoſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that by this <hi>MYSTERY,</hi> is chiefly meant, that the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which this Beaſt ſhould introduce and propagate, ſhould be no common, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, wilful, or affected <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> but ſuch as is conſiſtent with a ſhew of Piety towards God; Such as requires no little Artifice to contrive, and is not eaſy to detect; no <hi>groſs</hi> but <hi>ſubtile</hi> Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and not unworthy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Name. All which methinks may very fitly be comprized, in that one Word the <hi>Prophet</hi> uſeth, if we ſhould call it a Kind of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> or <hi>Idolatry in</hi> a <hi>Myſtery.</hi> But of this <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more hereafter at <hi>ver.</hi> 6. where
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:38410:158"/>it is ſaid of him, That <hi>he opened his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name, his Tabernacle, and they that dwell in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time let us hear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of him, as to ſhape, and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we have in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. where he is likened to <hi>a Leopard,</hi> that is, (as I conceive) the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 6, which of an intire Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divided into four Kingdoms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der four ſeveral Heads or Kings. For ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom alſo, which had been intire before, was now divided into ten ſmaller Kingdoms, under ten ſeveral Kings.</p>
               <p>But as the Body of this Kingdom was <hi>like the Leopard,</hi> or the <hi>Grecian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhattered in pieces as that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was: ſo in the Feet (the Inſtruments of Motion and Activity, and, in <hi>Bears,</hi> of preying and ſpoyling) it is ſaid to have bin <hi>like a Bear,</hi> that is, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Dan.</hi> vii. 5. For as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Kings would not engage in War,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:38410:158"/>nor enter upon any Action of great Moment, without conſulting of their <hi>Magi:</hi> ſo neither would theſe ten Kings that conſtitute the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, under its ſeventh or laſt Head the <hi>Popes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting of their <hi>Prieſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops.</hi> To which Purpoſe it is ſaid of the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Beaſt,</hi> that had <hi>two Horns like the Lamb;</hi> that <hi>he exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt (viz.</hi> the ſecular ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned Beaſt) before Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Which ſhews the great influence that the Churchmen were to have upon the Civil State. Inſomuch that the Angel tells us of theſe Ten Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 13, 17, That <hi>they ſhould give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom to the Beaſt;</hi> that is, to the ſeventh or laſt head of <hi>Rome</hi> and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which we have plainly ſhewn before to be the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops. And if we look upon theſe Kings as to their <hi>making War againſt the Saints,</hi> and ſetting up Idolatrous Worſhip, (which are the only things for which they are conſiderable in this place) it cannot be denied but that the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:38410:159"/>Civil State is wholly influenced by the Churchmen in them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>the Mouth</hi> of this ten-horned Beaſt, was <hi>like the Mouth of a Lion,</hi> that is, in ſpeaking, giving Commandments, making Laws, and the like, it reſembled the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Monarchy, likened to a <hi>Lion, Dan.</hi> vii. 4. For as the Kings of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and particularly King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> are infamous in holy Scripture for ſetting up Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worſhip, and commanding thoſe that refuſed to fall down before their Idols, to be burnt alive (as may be ſeen <hi>Dan.</hi> iii, in the caſe of <hi>Shadrach, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego.</hi>) So this ten-horned Beaſt with a like brutiſh rage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty ſhould inſtantly command all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> that is, all oppoſers of his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Edicts, to the fire and faggot. And therefore it is remarkably ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> (the Metropolis of that Eccleſiaſtick Beaſt, <hi>who exerciſeth all the Power</hi> of this ten-horned ſecular Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. <hi>ver.</hi> 12;) that ſhe was not only like <hi>Babylon</hi> in being the <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> but alſo
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:38410:159"/>that ſhe was <hi>drunken with the Blood of Saints, Rev.</hi> xvii. And of this ten-horned ſecular Beaſt himſelf it is ſaid in this xiii <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 7, That <hi>it was given to him to wake War with the Saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Beaſt who was like <hi>the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,</hi> and his <hi>Feet</hi> like the <hi>Bear's,</hi> and his <hi>Mouth</hi> like the <hi>Lion's,</hi> the <hi>Dragon gave his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority,</hi> (as is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) that is, be gave this Beaſt ſuch Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>making War againſt the Saints,</hi> (for this is the <hi>Power</hi> that is ſaid to have been given him, at <hi>ver.</hi> 7.) as the Roman Heathen Emperors, typified by <hi>a great red Dragon,</hi> Chap. xii. 3. had before him, together with their <hi>Seat</hi> Imperial too, the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon miſſing of his deſign in perſecuting the Woman in his own ſhape before by Heathen Emperours, and afterwards in caſting out a flood of waters after her under the Chriſtian Emperours; is now about to try the utmoſt of his Skill, and perſecute the Remnant of the Woman's

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:38410:163"/>For when <hi>St. Peter</hi> is ſaid to have asked our Saviour whether he ſhould forgive his Brother <hi>until ſeven times,</hi> and our Saviour anſwered him, <hi>until ſeventy times ſeven, Mat.</hi> xviii. 21, 22: as any man conſidering the circumſtances of this Text, would think that by <hi>ſeven</hi> were meant a ſmall <hi>uncertain</hi> number; and by <hi>ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> a great one: So if <hi>ſeven</hi> had been varied by <hi>five</hi> and <hi>two,</hi> by <hi>four</hi> and <hi>three,</hi> or by <hi>ſix</hi> and <hi>one,</hi> no man would have imagined, but that the <hi>preciſe</hi> and definite <hi>ſeptenary number</hi> had been meant by it.

If then we apply the ſame to our preſent caſe, where <hi>forty two Months</hi> are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty Dayes,</hi> and otherwiſe again by <hi>Three Yeares and a half,</hi> we may juſtly wonder if any man of but common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:38410:163"/>ſhould after to expound them of an <hi>uncertain</hi> time. But.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Thoſe <hi>certain</hi> numbers which in any language are put for <hi>uncertain,</hi> are uſually <hi>round numbers,</hi> as <hi>ten, a hundred, a thouſand,</hi> and the like; or elſe <hi>catching</hi> and <hi>retorting</hi> numbers, like that of our Saviour's <hi>ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> catching up and retorting upon <hi>St. Peter's ſeven;</hi> or elſe they are ſome <hi>certain</hi> numbers which by the peculiar uſe of any Language are <hi>uncertainly</hi> underſtood. But as for theſe numbers of <hi>forty two, One thouſand two hundred and ſixty,</hi> and <hi>three and an half,</hi> they are neither <hi>round</hi> numbers nor <hi>retorting</hi> numbers, neither are they any where uſed in the Greek or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, or any other Language that I know of, for <hi>uncertain</hi> numbers. But</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. If we conſider that one of theſe numbers is a <hi>mixt</hi> number, (<hi>viz.</hi> three <hi>and an half</hi>) compounded of a whole number and a fraction, we ſhall perceive a further reaſon yet, why they cannot be expounded in an <hi>uncertain</hi> ſenſe. For there is no reaſon to be given why any
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:38410:164"/>
                  <hi>fraction</hi> ſhould be added to a <hi>whole</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but only for the limiting and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of its ſignification. Surely no language in <hi>uncertain</hi> numbers is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and punctual to a <hi>fraction.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that by this number of <hi>forty two months,</hi> the time allotted for the continuance of this ten-horned Beaſt under the headſhip and ſupremacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, is the <hi>certain,</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and limited term of <hi>forty and two months, One thouſand two hundred and ſixty Dayes,</hi> or <hi>three Years and an half.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now there will remain but this Queſtion more to be decided, Whether theſe months, and years, and days, be meant of <hi>common</hi> months, and years, and days, or of <hi>Prophetical,</hi> that is, as <hi>Prophets</hi> ſometimes mean in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; with whom 'tis no unuſual thing to ſpeak of <hi>days</hi> inſtead of <hi>years.</hi> For the reſolution of which Queſtion, I ſhall lay down this as an undoubted Truth, <hi>That in any difficulties ariſing concerning this ten-horned Beaſt here ſpoken of, if they be capable of more good, allowable, Scripture
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:38410:164"/>ſenſes than one, we are to guide our ſelves by the authority of the Angel,</hi> Rev. xvii, <hi>and to chooſe that which is moſt agreeable to the interpretation of the</hi> Beaſt, <hi>which he has there given us.</hi> Now that <hi>dayes</hi> in Scripture Prophecy are ſometimes put to typify <hi>years,</hi> is evident from two remarkable Prophecies which we have to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>One is <hi>Ezek.</hi> iv. 4, 5, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is commanded of God <hi>to lie upon his left ſide,</hi> and to lay the iniquities of the houſe of Iſrael upon it <hi>three hundred and ninety dayes,</hi> and God tells him, that <hi>he has laid upon him the years of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> according to the number of the <hi>days;</hi> that is, that he ſhould bear the iniquity of the houſe of Iſrael as many <hi>dayes,</hi> as they ſhould bear them <hi>years,</hi> or, that his bearing them <hi>three hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes,</hi> ſhould ſignify to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they ſhould bear their own iniquity as many <hi>years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo again at <hi>ver.</hi> 6, the Prophet is commanded, that when he has accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the three hundred and ninety
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:38410:165"/>
                  <hi>dayes</hi> upon his <hi>left</hi> ſide, he ſhould lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon his <hi>right</hi> ſide, and <hi>beare the iniquity of the houſe of Judah forty dayes,</hi> and God tells him again, that <hi>he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him each day for a year,</hi> that is, that each <hi>day</hi> of his bearing the iniquity of the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhould ſignify to the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they ſhould bear their own iniquity a <hi>year;</hi> and ſo the Prophets <hi>forty dayes</hi> ſhould ſignify to them as <hi>many years.</hi> From whence we would infer no more then this, which any one may perceive to be the natural reſult of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>yeares in Prophecy may be typified by dayes,</hi> or, that each <hi>day</hi> of the continuance of the Type, may ſtand to ſignify <hi>a year</hi> in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. So that in our preſent caſe the <hi>forty two months, three years and an half,</hi> or <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes</hi> of the continuance of the Type, may ſignify as many <hi>dayes of years, and months of years,</hi> and <hi>years of years</hi> in the accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>Another like inſtance we have in <hi>Dan.</hi> ix. 24. where <hi>ſeventy weeks</hi> in the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:38410:165"/>Prophecy, are confeſſedly put for <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty weeks of years,</hi> (or ſeventy times ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years) in the accompliſhment, each <hi>day</hi> of the week repreſenting a <hi>Year,</hi> And though <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Rom. Pont. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> tells us that <hi>Dayes</hi> are not here put for <hi>Years,</hi> becauſe in Hebrew the word <hi>Schabuahh</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Week,</hi> is derived from <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bahh</hi> ſignifying <hi>ſeven,</hi> and therefore may ſignify <hi>ſeven Years</hi> as well as <hi>ſeven Days,</hi> ſo that <hi>Dayes</hi> are not here put for <hi>Years,</hi> nor <hi>Weeks of Dayes</hi> for <hi>Weeks of Years,</hi> but only <hi>Schabuahh</hi> a <hi>Week</hi> derived from <hi>Schebahh ſeven,</hi> is ſet to ſignify <hi>ſeven Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this we reply, that the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Words, is not wholly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from their <hi>Etymologie</hi> or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but from their <hi>uſe;</hi> as might be ſhewn, if need were, from many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of inſtances. We ſhall therefore content our ſelves with only one at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is the moſt appoſite that I can think of to this purpoſe. For in the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:38410:166"/>Greek Language the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not only comes from a word that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>ſeven,</hi> but does it ſelf alſo ſignify the ſeptenary number, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies an <hi>unite,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the number ten. But when this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is applyed to <hi>time,</hi> it never ſignifies <hi>ſeven Hours,</hi> or <hi>ſeven Weeks,</hi> or <hi>ſeven Months,</hi> or <hi>ſeven Years,</hi> but always <hi>ſeven Dayes,</hi> as if it were conſtantly written out at length <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>ſeven Dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we ſay therefore of the Hebrew word <hi>Shabuahh,</hi> which though it comes from a word which ſignifies <hi>ſeven,</hi> yet being put abſolutely (as here it is) without any other word to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min its ſignification otherwiſe, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly throughout the Bible underſtood of <hi>ſeven Dayes.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Daniel's ſeventy Weeks,</hi> are put to ſignify <hi>ſeventy Weeks of Years,</hi> we may certainly conclude from the conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of the Hebrew word, that <hi>Weeks of Dayes</hi> (for ſo the word put abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does always ſignifie) are put for <hi>Weeks of Years,</hi> and conſequently that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:38410:166"/>
                  <hi>Days</hi> are put for <hi>Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Cardinal to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his argument, obſerves that in <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. there is mention of <hi>Weeks of Years,</hi> but no where of <hi>Dayes of Years,</hi> or <hi>Months of Years;</hi> becauſe the Hebrew word for <hi>Week</hi> being derived from a word that ſignifies <hi>ſeven,</hi> may be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>ſeven Years</hi> as well as <hi>ſeven Dayes;</hi> but there is not the ſame reaſon why the other words for <hi>Days and Months</hi> ſhould be ſo uſed.</p>
               <p>But to this we anſwer, that if the Cardinal could have produced any place of Scripture, where the Hebrew word for <hi>Week,</hi> put abſolutely, had ſignified a <hi>Week of Years,</hi> he had then done his buſineſs. For thence it would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the word put abſolutely might have ſignified either <hi>a Week of Dayes,</hi> or a <hi>Week of Years,</hi> according to the circumſtances of the place wherein it were uſed. But inſtead of that he hath produced a place, not where <hi>a Week</hi> put abſolutely doth ſignify a <hi>Week of Years,</hi> (which is the caſe in <hi>Daniel's Weeks</hi>)
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:38410:167"/>but where <hi>a Week of Years</hi> does ſignify <hi>a Week of Years.</hi> Whence we return his argument from <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv, upon himſelf; for if the Hebrew word for <hi>Week</hi> does alwayes ſignify a <hi>Week of Dayes,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the ſignfication of it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the addition of <hi>Years,</hi> or ſome ſuch other word, then muſt the <hi>Weeks</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo, ſince they are ſet abſolutely without any ſuch addition, be put to ſignify <hi>Weeks of Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which alſo may be further cleared from this conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>Week</hi> in Hebrew is never expreſſed by <hi>a Week of dayes,</hi> although a <hi>Week of dayes</hi> be always meant by it, but when they would expreſs a <hi>Week of Years,</hi> they ſpeak it out at length <hi>a Week of Years.</hi> Whence it appeares, that by a <hi>week</hi> put abſolutely they mean a <hi>week of days,</hi> as certainly as if it were expreſt at length a <hi>week of days.</hi> Hence therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the conſtant and perpetual uſe of the word in holy Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception, that by <hi>Daniels ſeventy weeks</hi> are meant <hi>ad literam, ſeventy weeks
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:38410:167"/>of days.</hi> But ſince this Prophecy cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> ſaith concerning a <hi>month,</hi> that we never read of a <hi>month of years,</hi> becauſe a <hi>month</hi> in Hebrew is not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from a word of number, but is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the courſe of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which ſhe abſolves in thirty Dayes, yet by his favour, as a <hi>Month</hi> put abſolutely does (as himſelf confeſſeth) ſignifie the ſpace of thirty <hi>dayes,</hi> ſo with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>years,</hi> a <hi>Month of years</hi> would ſignifie <hi>thirty years,</hi> as well as a <hi>week of years</hi> would ſignifie <hi>ſeven years.</hi> So that, as <hi>weeks</hi> in Prophecy are put for <hi>weeks of years,</hi> which otherwhere do never ſignify but <hi>weeks of dayes.</hi> So <hi>Months,</hi> which otherwhere are never uſed but for <hi>Months of dayes,</hi> may yet in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy

               </p>
               <p>But he further urges concerning theſe <hi>three years and an half, forty two months;</hi> or <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> that thereby can be meant no more than <hi>common years, months,</hi> &amp; <hi>days,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid with reſpect to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 12, that <hi>the Devil is come down having great wrath, as knowing that he hath but a ſhort time.</hi> If then by <hi>three years and an half</hi> be meant but a <hi>ſhort time,</hi> they cannot be expounded to typifie <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years,</hi> (which is a very long time) but <hi>one thouſand two hundred and ſixty common dayes.</hi> But here alſo the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſhould have put on his conſidering cap again. For all quantities of time, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:38410:170"/>thing, are ſmall or great, ſhort or long reſpectively, according to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſmaller quantities that they are compared with, and for many other conſiderations. For even three Years and an half may be accounted a long time in compariſon of half a Year; and again, even halfe a Year would be thought a long time by him that ſhould be afflicted all that time with continual pains of the Gout, or any other extream torture. And if a man were to travel Six thouſand Miles, and condemned to loſe his life, ſo ſoon as he arrived at his journeys end; I believe he would eſteem his whole journey but a very ſhort one, eſpecially if he were to be careſſed all along with ſatisfactions and delights: But when he ſhould have accompliſhed almoſt five thouſand miles, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he might well be born with, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how far he had already travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and how little in compariſon he had remaining, together with the miſeries that attend him at his journeys end, he ſhould complain that the remaining
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:38410:171"/>twelve or thirteen hundred miles were very ſhort.</p>
               <p>Now this applyed to our preſent caſe, will fully anſwer what the Cardinal hath objected. For Satan having deceived the World already, (which was his chief delight,) for near five thouſand Years, and knowing to what endleſs miſeries he ſtood condemned at the end of twelve or thirteen hundred Years then next enſuing, might well both in compariſon of that much longer time already paſſed, and alſo in conſideration of his future miſeries, when the whole ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, eſteem the time remaining very ſhort. And for this reaſon it is, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 17.) calls the <hi>heavieſt</hi> afflictions of the Saints in this life but <hi>light,</hi> and the <hi>longeſt</hi> but for <hi>a moment,</hi> in compariſon of that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> which their light and momentany affliction worketh for them.</p>
               <p>And now if notwithſtanding all that has been ſaid to prove theſe <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> and <hi>Years</hi> that we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:38410:171"/>of, to be <hi>Prophetical, Typical,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,</hi> or by whatever other Name Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are wont to call them, any man ſhall yet contend that they are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>common months,</hi> and <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>years:</hi> let him conſider, 1ſt, That where there is one Phraſe, or Paſſage, or Expreſſion in the Revelation <hi>Literal,</hi> there are an hundred <hi>Figurative and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical.</hi> And in this part of it that we are now upon, it is manifeſt that an <hi>Empire</hi> is deſigned by a <hi>Beaſt, ſeven Kings</hi> by <hi>ſeven Heads, ten Kings</hi> by <hi>ten Horns,</hi> the <hi>Place</hi> that one King ariſeth out of, by the <hi>Earth;</hi> that which another comes out of, by the <hi>Sea;</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Beaſt, by a <hi>Woman;</hi> the <hi>Peoples</hi> ſubject to her Juriſdiction, by <hi>Waters;</hi> and I believe there is hardly any one <hi>Word</hi> or Paſſage in this Prophecy, which can in any tolerable ſenſe be <hi>Figuratively</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but <hi>ſo</hi> it ought to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Since therefore it appears moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, (from that place of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> afore quoted) that <hi>dayes</hi> in Scripture-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have been ſet to typifie <hi>years;</hi> and

               <p n="2">2ly.

This worthy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor then (many of whoſe failings in the Explicating of the xiith and xiiith Chapters I have purpoſely omitted, meerly out of that honour I bear to his Pious memory, and his other learned Writings,) in his Annotations upon this Place, confeſſing that <hi>the beſt and ancienteſt Copies</hi> read this Place, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) (which he interprets to <hi>ſpend</hi> or <hi>ſtay</hi> forty and two Months,) adds theſe Words: <hi>And then</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>to ſtay ſo many Months, is to live ſo long; which
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:38410:173"/>was punctually true of</hi> Domitian, <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Perſecution in the thirteenth, and died in the ſixteenth year of his Reign.</hi> Where obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, That <hi>Domitian</hi> might have <hi>begun</hi> his Perſecution in the <hi>thirteenth,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the <hi>ſixteenth</hi> year of his reign, and yet not have perſecuted <hi>one Month,</hi> much leſs <hi>forty and two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly, That he might have <hi>begun</hi> his Perſecution in the <hi>thirteenth</hi> Year of his Reign, and not <hi>ended</hi> it till the <hi>ſixteenth,</hi> and yet not have perſecuted <hi>five and twenty Months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. It does not follow that <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an lived</hi> but <hi>forty and two Months,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>began</hi> his perſecution in the 13th and <hi>died</hi> in the 16th Year of his Reign.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:38410:174"/>his Reign.</hi> Let the Reader ſee whether this were <hi>punctually true,</hi> or not, but I am confident he will hardly ſay that the Doctor has made it <hi>punctually</hi> out, and we may as confidently believe he would have <hi>prov'd</hi> it <hi>punctually,</hi> as wel as <hi>ſaid</hi> it, if it had been eaſy to be done.</p>
               <p>But it may be the Doctor has better explain'd himſelf touching this point, in ſome other Place. Let us ſee therefore what he ſayes of this matter in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</hi> For there, diſputing againſt <hi>Baronius,</hi> who affirms St. <hi>John</hi> to have been baniſht by <hi>Domitian</hi> in the <hi>tenth</hi> Year of his Reign, and ſpeaking of the ſame Emperour's baniſhing his Couſin <hi>Flaccia Domitilla, that</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>was five Years after this Time of John's ſuppoſed Baniſhment, in the fifteenth or laſt Year of</hi> Domitian<hi>'s Reign.</hi> Theſe are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's own Words in his <hi>Premonition,</hi> though in his <hi>Annotations</hi> he affirms <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But ſtill <hi>Domitian</hi> might <hi>perſecute</hi> Chriſtians <hi>forty and two Months.</hi> Hear
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:38410:174"/>therfore what the Doctor himſelf quotes out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the Place before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and makes uſe of againſt <hi>Baronius.</hi> Domitian (ſaies he) <hi>went about to do as</hi> Nero <hi>had done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſed facilè caeptum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but he ceaſed from it preſently, and recalled thoſe whom he had baniſhed.</hi> But now if <hi>Domitian</hi> perſecuted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>forty two Months,</hi> how comes <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> (comparing <hi>Domitian's</hi> Perſecution with <hi>Nero</hi>'s) to ſay that <hi>he ceaſed preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nero</hi> himſelf did not perſecute Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by publick Edict, above <hi>thirty and ſix Months,</hi> and therefore if <hi>Domitian</hi> perſecuted them <hi>forty and two Months,</hi> how can he be ſaid in compariſon with <hi>Nero</hi> to have <hi>ceaſed preſently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See therefore, Reader, how altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unapplicable theſe <hi>forty and two</hi> Months are to <hi>Domitian,</hi> (or indeed to any other) in a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, and therefore till a better can be found, let us embrace the <hi>Typical,</hi> which appears to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſence that they are capable of.</p>
               <p>I might further add concerning this typifying of <hi>Years</hi> by <hi>dayes,</hi> that which
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:38410:175"/>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath learnedly proved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Dayes in <hi>Daniel,</hi> whereof there is mention in the xiith <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 11, 12; viz. that neither his <hi>one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety dayes,</hi> nor his <hi>one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred and thirty five dayes,</hi> can in any wiſe be underſtood of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Dayes but of <hi>prophetical,</hi> ſuch as whereof every <hi>day</hi> doth repreſent a <hi>year.</hi> And he obſerves further, that where at any time in <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophecy we meet with <hi>dayes</hi> that muſt be underſtood of <hi>common dayes,</hi> they are not called in the Hebrew <hi>days,</hi> but <hi>Evenings, Mornings.</hi> An inſtance of which we have <hi>Dan.</hi> viii. 14. But I need ſay no more in ſo clear a caſe, having ſaid enough already to prove what I intend, which is no more then this, to wit, that by <hi>dayes</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy may be typified <hi>years,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurdity in reaſon, or incongruity to Scripture-uſage.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let us ſee from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Prophecy we were ſpeaking of, whether the <hi>two and forty Months</hi> allotted for the continuance of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:38410:175"/>the Beaſt, ought rather to be underſtood each <hi>Month</hi> for thirty <hi>common,</hi> or for the ſame number of <hi>Prophetick</hi> Dayes; that is, as ſet to typify <hi>thirty dayes,</hi> or <hi>thirty Years;</hi> that ſo <hi>forty and two Months</hi> may typify <hi>two and forty times thirty,</hi> or <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this matter is very eaſily decided. For we ſee plainly that theſe <hi>two and forty Months</hi> are all the time that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for the Continuance of thoſe ten-crowned <hi>Horns, ver.</hi> 1. which upon the Deſtruction of the ſeventh King (the <hi>Chriſtian Roman Emperours</hi>) were to be united into one Kingdom under the Headſhip and Supremacy of the <hi>Roman Biſhops.</hi> And ſince we have cleared this Point from the interpretation which the Angel gives us of that Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii, where he tells us, <hi>the ten Horns are ten Kings, which have receiv'd no Kingdom as yet, but receive Power as Kings one Hour with the</hi> ſeventh or laſt Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and that theſe Kings ſhould <hi>give their Power, and Strength,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:38410:176"/>to them: Experience it ſelf hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed to us, that theſe ten Kingdoms have continued ſo united, and the Headſhip and Supremacy of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops, to <hi>give their Power, Strength, and Kingdom</hi> to them more or leſs, for above theſe <hi>thouſand Years,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that their continuing <hi>two and forty Months</hi> cannot be underſtood of <hi>two and forty common Months,</hi> but of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Years</hi> as in the common acceptation of them, they would ſignify <hi>days,</hi> that is, <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may be alſo further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from our Experience of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's continuing in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> For from <hi>Rev.</hi> xii, it plainly appears that ſhe was to continue in the Wilderneſs <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty dayes;</hi> and that her Wilderneſs-ſtate is to be reckoned from the time of her being fled thither upon the <hi>two Wings</hi> of that <hi>great Eagle,</hi> the Roman Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Weſtern and the Eaſtern Parts of it, as it ſtood divided under the Chriſtian Emperours. Now theſe <hi>two Wings</hi> were
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:38410:176"/>broken aſunder upon the incurſion of the barbarous Nations, when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours were utterly deſtroyed, and the <hi>ten Horns</hi> aroſe together with that laſt Head of the blaſphemous Beaſt, to whom they were to <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may obſerve, that preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Woman's flying into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon thoſe <hi>two Wings of the great Eagle, Rev.</hi> xii. the next thing preſented at the beginning of <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii. is the Beaſt with <hi>ten Horns</hi> crowned. From this time therefore we are to reckon the Woman's continuing in the Wilderneſs. But from the Analogy of the Type it ſelf, nothing can be plainer, than that ſhe was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> till ſhe arrived at the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither ſhe was and ſtill is travelling, and therefore her continuance in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> muſt have been much longer than <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty common days,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they muſt be put to typify as many <hi>Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore we reckon One thouſand
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:38410:177"/>two hundred and ſixty Years from the Woman's being fled into the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> or, which comes all to one, from the <hi>ten Horns</hi> appearing with <hi>Crowns</hi> on their Heads, that is, from about the Year four hundred and fifty ſix, we ſhall find them to expire about the Year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixteen. And there abouts we may expect the expiration of the Beaſt's Supremacy. Not as if we could certainly determin of that Point of time, when theſe one thouſand two hundred and ſixty Years ſhould end preciſely (for we muſt leave that to his Wiſdom in whoſe only hand <hi>the Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons</hi> are,) but this we ſay, that by that term of Days, and Months, and Years, is meant a definite, not uncertain Time, and that they muſt be underſtood not literally, but in the ſence of <hi>Prophecy</hi> for <hi>Annual Days,</hi> and Months, and Years, <hi>viz.</hi> for Days, and Months, and Years of Years. And further, that we can ſee no other likelyhood but that they will expire within ſome reaſonable Latitude of that Time that we have ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:38410:177"/>
               <p>But yet I muſt confeſs I am of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that no mortal Man, from the moſt accurate Inſpection of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, can certainly define the time, no, not within the Compaſs of one hundred Years or more, which in ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as one thouſand two hundred and ſixty, are not much conſiderable. And thus much of the <hi>two and forty Months</hi> allotted for the Continuance of this Beaſt. Let us now proceed to thoſe other Characters and Deſcriptions which are given of him.</p>
               <p>As it is ſaid of him at <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that <hi>there was given to him a Mouth ſpeaking great things, and Blaſphemies:</hi> ſo accordingly it is ſaid in the next Verſe, that <hi>he opened his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and thoſe that dwell in Heaven.</hi> Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, I ſuppoſe, it neither can, nor will be denied that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince they came to be the Head of this ten-horned ſecular Kingdom, have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken things exceeding great and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, ſuch as no Potentate ever ſpake
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:38410:178"/>beſides them; as, that they are the ſole Vicars of Chriſt on Earth, the Head of the univerſal Church, to whom all mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Men muſt needs be ſubject, if they would be ſaved; that they are infallible in determining of Religious Matters, be their Life and Converſation never ſo deteſtable; that they are appointed over the Kingdoms of the World, to build and to plant, to root them up, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow them, as they ſee expedient; with many other ſuch like Claims, and great Prerogatives, which they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves. Yet poſſible it may not ſeem ſo clear, how they who own themſelves <hi>the Servants of the Servants of God,</hi> and who adore his Saints, and even their very Shrines and Reliques with Religious Honour, can be ſaid to <hi>blaſpheme the Name of God, and his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and thoſe that dwell in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince theſe things have been <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told</hi> concerning them, they muſt have been <hi>fulfilled</hi> in them; and how that has been done is no hard matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. For by this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> here is meant
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:38410:178"/>Idolatry. And ſo this Deſcription of the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt, Chap.</hi> xiii, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly parallel to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, Chap.</hi> xvii; where ſhe is called the <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> and is ſaid to have made <hi>the Kings of the Earth</hi> (to wit, theſe ten Horns or Kings here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, acknowledging the Headſhip and Supremacy of her Biſhops) <hi>drunk with the Cup of her Fornications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>blaſpheme the Name of God</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to diſhonour him, by giving of his Name, his Worſhip, or his Attributes to any other, which whether the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their worſhiping of Images, and Reliques, Saints, and Sacrament, be guilty of, or not, is not my Buſineſs to determin. For I have ſufficiently proved from all the Characters, and Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Angel gives us of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Metropolis, the Heads and Horns of this Beaſt, that he is ſet to typifie the <hi>Roman Biſhops.</hi> If ſo, it follows upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Truth of this Prophecy, that they <hi>blaſpheme the Name of God,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore let the Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:38410:179"/>ſee to it, for all the World beſides are made too ſenſible of this their <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> and Idolatry, and would ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd to ſee this Prophecy thus fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in them.</p>
               <p>But beſides this Beaſt's <hi>blaſpheming of the Name of God,</hi> it is further added, that he blaſphemed God's <hi>Tabernacle</hi> alſo. Now by the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God cannot be meant <hi>Heaven, for that's the</hi> Place of God's eternal <hi>Reſidence;</hi> whereas a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in Scripture-Phraſe does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie a Place of <hi>ſojourning,</hi> or of tranſitory abode. And I believe we ſhall find but two things that can in any good-approved Scripture-ſenſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Tabernacles of God,</hi> and can tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably be accommodated to our preſent purpoſe: One is the <hi>Body of Chriſt;</hi> the other the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in both which God ſojourned as in <hi>Tabernacles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> may in a Scripture-ſence be fitly called the <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> of God, appears from thoſe Places of Scripture, where the <hi>Body</hi> of Man is called his <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> For if the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:38410:179"/>
                  <hi>Body of Man</hi> be <hi>Man's Tabernacle:</hi> then the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> in whom all <hi>the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwelled bodily,</hi> is the <hi>Tabernacle of God.</hi> The Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then to this purpoſe are, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 1. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, 14. In the firſt of theſe Places, <hi>St. Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Happineſs of the Saints after this life, hath theſe Words; <hi>We know,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that if our earthly Houſe of this</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle <hi>were diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> And a little after at <hi>ver.</hi> 4. he adds, <hi>For we that are in this Tabernacle do groan, being burdened,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſame Metaphor is uſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by <hi>St. Peter,</hi> in the Places cited out of his Epiſtle, where, ſpeaking of his own Death, he has theſe Words; <hi>I think it meet as long as I am in this</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>to ſtir you up, by putting you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>even as our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me.</hi> From which Places it appears evidently that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-language the <hi>Body</hi> is a <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:38410:180"/>And ſo by conſequence, the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And for the ſame Reaſon the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> alſo, in whoſe moſt bleſſed Womb Chriſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed for a time, as in a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> may here in Prophecy be repreſented by the ſame Type.</p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> we have yet a more particular and expreſs Place of Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 11. Where the Apoſtle comparing the Prieſthood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> calls <hi>the Body of</hi> Chriſt <hi>a greater and more perfect Tabernacle</hi> than the <hi>Jewiſh was.</hi> For by <hi>that greater and more perfect Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> it is evident that the Apoſtle means the <hi>Body of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are both ſufficiently blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and diſhonoured by the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to be here inſiſted on: For as for the Body of Chriſt, we know they own the very Sacrament of it to be God, the very God and great Creator of the World, the very true ſubſtantial Body
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:38410:180"/>and Blood, together with the Godhead of our Saviour Chriſt. And therefore through this Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt they manifeſtly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God, yea, and his <hi>Name,</hi> and Godhead alſo, in that they make an <hi>Idol</hi> of it. For whilſt they own it to be <hi>God,</hi> which of it ſelf is no light <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> they ſay, and are not able to deny but that it may be eaten and devour'd by Man, nay, even by wicked Men, nay, even by Rats and Mice, and further, that it may be ſtoln, or pawn'd, or carried on Mens Shoulders, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch like Blaſphemies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, as great as any of thoſe moſt opprobrious [Sarcaſms] wherewith the Spirit of God in Holy Scripture does worthily deride the Heathen Idols. And by this means, they not only have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle of God</hi> themſelves, but have alſo given great Offences, and Occaſions to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and in general to all that are profeſſed Enemies of the Goſpel, to vilifie and deſpiſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's God.</p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:38410:181"/>
               <p>And as to their <hi>blaſpheming</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> we may juſtly reckon, that greater <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> cannot be committed againſt that glorious Saint, than whilſt with impudent Violation of her Virgin-Modeſty, and moſt profound Humility, ſhe is exalted by her Idolatrous Zealots to the throne of her Creator, and made a kind of Rival and Competitrix with him, if not (which I abhor to think) in many things ſuperiour to him. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Pſalter of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (as they call it) publickly own'd, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the buſineſs of which Pſalter is, in imitation of the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> praiſing <hi>God,</hi> to magnifie the Glories of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And in purſuit of this Deſign, <hi>her Name</hi> is put inſtead of <hi>God's.</hi> As for Example, we have there ſuch Addreſſes as theſe, <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Hearts do love thee, O Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>their Sins by thee ſhall be mercifully waſhed away. Have Mercy upon me,</hi> O Lady, <hi>who art called the Mother of Mercy, and according to the Bowels of thy Mercy,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:38410:181"/>cleanſe me from all mine Iniquities. Save me,</hi> Lady, <hi>by thy Name, and deliver me from mine unrighteouſneſs. Give the King thy Judgement, O God, and thy Mercy to the</hi> Queen <hi>his Mother. O come let us ſing unto our</hi> Lady, <hi>let us make a joyful Noiſe to</hi> Mary <hi>our Queen, that brings Salvation. O our Omnipotent</hi> Lady! <hi>thou art my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, thou haſt freed me, condemned to Death; thou art the beginning, and the finiſher of my Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I believe all Proteſtants are ſo far convinced of the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of theſe and other like Expreſſions, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God,</hi> but alſo againſt the bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> that they would think that the very Stones and Stocks the Papiſts worſhip, if they <hi>had Ears to hear, and Eyes to ſee, and Mouths to ſpeak,</hi> would even complain that they themſelves by their Adorers were <hi>blaſphemed.</hi> For though they be compoſed of Wood and Stone, yet have they not ſo hard a Forehead, as knowingly to admit the Honours of their great Creator. And certainly they would with much more
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:38410:182"/>Modeſty refer the Worſhip that is given them to their God, than it is performed, or perhaps pretended by the Zeal and Ignorance of their <hi>Relative Worſhipers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, as for their <hi>blaſpheming</hi> of the Saints <hi>which dwell in Heaven:</hi> we muſt apply this alſo to the like Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Practices and Addreſſes to them. For unleſs we think that theſe moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons have together with their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> left their <hi>Graces</hi> alſo here behind them, how can it be imagined that they ſhould not bluſh (if they have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or perception of the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) to hear and ſee thoſe Prayers, Praiſes and Devotions which are paid them at their Shrines and Temples. Whereby although they are pretended to be <hi>honoured,</hi> yet indeed they are <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi> in a double Sence: one way, by being put in place of <hi>God,</hi> who is the only object of religious Prayer; and on the other ſide, by being brought in the Place of Heathen <hi>Daemons,</hi> as having juſt ſuch Services performed, and ſuch Offices aſſigned to them. And as the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:38410:182"/>one is too great an Honour for created beings: ſo the other is too vile an Office for thoſe glorious Spirits; and ſo both wayes they are moſt ſhamefully <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I muſt add, that I <hi>believe,</hi> (for here I do not pretend to <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt the Roman Superſtitions, but only to give a hint of ſuch, wherein, as I conceive, this Prophecy is fullfilled) that thoſe bleſſed Spirits would think it a great Honour to them, to be put in Place of Heathen <hi>Daemons,</hi> (if they could ſo eſcape <hi>religious</hi> Honour;) in compariſon of that much more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reproach of being put in Place of <hi>God.</hi> For ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> for one, has as good as told us, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 3. where he profeſſes himſelf to be ſo intent upon the Glory of God, that for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Glory in the Converſion of the Jews, he could even wiſh himſelf <hi>Anathema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what we have here ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their blaſpheming of the <hi>Saints</hi> which dwell in Heaven, is every whit as appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:38410:183"/>to the <hi>Angels,</hi> who being worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with like Honours and Addreſſes, are alike <hi>blaſphemed.</hi> And indeed ſince all Honour, Glory, Power, Praiſe, and whatſoever other Attribute of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does belong originally to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, by the moſt abſolute and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right, whoever ſhall preſume to give theſe Attributes in any ſort to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever, without the Warrant of God's holy Word, does give God's Honour to another. And he that does give more Honour than is warrantable by the ſame, is guilty of the ſame Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This I ſay, becauſe the Romaniſts depend ſo much upon that weak diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia.</hi> For, <hi>All Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> is <hi>divine;</hi> and the giving of any to a forbidden Object, or to a lawfull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more Honour than is due, is to be guilty of Idolatry. And thus we have given a brief account of that which was foretold of this Beaſt, that <hi>he opened his Mouth in Blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Name, his Tabernacle,</hi> and <hi>them that dwell in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:38410:183"/>
               <p>In the next Verſe we have the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Power</hi> of this Beaſt, and of the <hi>Extent</hi> of his Dominion. As for his <hi>Power,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>it was given him to make War with the Saints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them.</hi> This Beaſt therefore was to be but a cowardly Beaſt, in that the chief of his Power conſiſted not in <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War</hi> with other <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but only with the <hi>Saints,</hi> which of themſelves are the moſt gentle and defenceleſs ſort of People in the World. But this is not to be underſtood, as if theſe ten Horns, or Kings, each one conſidered ſeverally and apart, ſhould have no other Power, for they are ſecular Princes, and have the ſame Power as any other Princes have, to war with any Beaſt or Kingdom that offends them: But that theſe Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the ſecular Kingdom of the Roman Biſhops, and united under his Headſhip and Supremacy, ſhould have no other Power but <hi>to make War againſt the Saints,</hi> that is, againſt ſuch as oppos'd themſelves to their Corruptions, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and Idolatries; at leaſt, that this
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:38410:184"/>ſhould be the main and moſt notorious inſtance of their <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is remarkably ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 13, 14. Firſt, that <hi>they ſhould have one mind, and give their Power and Strength unto the Beaſt,</hi> (that is, that they ſhould be united into one Kingdom under the Headſhip and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, by giving them <hi>their Power and Strength)</hi> And then it follows immediately after, that they ſhould <hi>make War with the Lamb,</hi> which is the ſame <hi>War</hi> in effect with that which they were to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Saints,</hi> with this only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That conſidered as <hi>a War againſt the Saints,</hi> theſe Kings ſhould <hi>overcome them;</hi> but conſidered as <hi>a War againſt the Lamb,</hi> the Lamb ſhould in the end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt thoſe cruel Enemies, and malicious Perſecutors of his Saints.</p>
               <p>But then as to the <hi>extent</hi> of this Beaſt's Dominion, it is ſaid, that <hi>Power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations;</hi> that is, over all the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Tongues, and Nations that were

               <p>And now let us ſee what ſence the

                  <hi>Paraphraſe on</hi> Rev. xiii.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And I ſtood in a Place of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proſpect to behold the riſing of the two Kingdoms hereafter deſcribed; and I ſaw a Beaſt, or Kingdom, which was the Idolatrous <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that had enjoied ſix ſeveral ſorts of Heads, or ſupream Governments, before, ariſing now out of the Nations ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, under its ſeventh Head the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops; the Empire coming now to be divided amongſt ten Kings, acknowledging the Supremacy of thoſe Biſhops, and ſo united into one Kingdom under them; and this laſt Head, as the other ſix had been, was marked with <hi>a Name of Blaſphemy,</hi> to denote his likeneſs to them in Idolatrous Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Kingdom which I ſaw, was divided into many Kingdoms, like the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy; and it was actuated by the Councils of its Religious Men,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:38410:187"/>like the Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and it gave out Idolatrous Laws and Edicts, under the penalty of fire and faggot, like that of the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And the Dragon, who had before employed the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, did now beſtow the ſame <hi>Power, and Seat, and great Authority,</hi> upon the Head of this ten-horned Kingdom, (to wit, upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops) to <hi>make War againſt the Saints</hi> (by the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of theſe ten Kings, who <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom,</hi> to them for this purpoſe) as the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours had done before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this Beaſt (the Blaſphemous Roman Empire) appeared to me to have received a mortal wound, by the Sword of the Spirit of God, in his ſixth Head the Heathen Emperours; but this wound upon the diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire amongſt ten Kings, was healed by the Dragon's Artifice in ſubſtituting another Head (the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops,) to whom thoſe ten Kings did <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom,</hi> for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:38410:187"/>the reſtoring of Idolatrous Worſhip, and perſecuting the Oppoſers of it. And all the <hi>Roman</hi> World applauded the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance wonderfully.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And they obeyed the Idolatrous Laws and Conſtitutions of this their new Supream Head and Governour, though indeed the <hi>Dragon</hi> was the chief Author of them: and they devoted themſelves to him with a cheerfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, applauding his unparralleld Power and greatneſs, ſaying, What King may be compared to him? Which of the puny Enemies of our Religion are able to ſtand out againſt him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And there was given unto him a Mouth ſpeaking great things, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</hi> For he enacted Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and would have all men whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obey him under the ſevereſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties both of temporal and eternal Flames.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:38410:188"/>for all this great and long Apoſtacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, and the heavy preſſure and perſecution of God's faithful Servants; that he hath abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own Cauſe, or the Cauſe of thoſe that ſuffer for his fake.

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>An Expoſition of</hi> Rev. xiii, <hi>from</hi> ver. 11, <hi>to the end. And therein, Of the</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Power <hi>of the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhops, conſider'd as the pretended</hi> Vicars <hi>of Chriſt, Succeſſors of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> Head <hi>of the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick Church. To the expoſition of which part of the Chapter is ſubjoyn'd a Paraphraſe; and to that, the Concluſion of the whole Treatiſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the xviith Chapter, the Angel in his Interpretation makes mention of no Power as appertaining to the laſt Head of the Beaſt, but only that which he enjoyeth by the Favour of thoſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> which were to ſhare the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire amongſt them, and to ariſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him. But as there it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that this ſeventh Head and King fell out to be the <hi>Roman Biſhops:</hi> ſo here (to juſtify that Interpretation to the higheſt Degree of certainty that a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:38410:189"/>Prophecy can be capable of) we have a plain deſcription both of their <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Power, as <hi>Kings;</hi> and of their Power in the <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Biſhops:</hi> And <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſays St. <hi>John</hi> at ver. 11.) <hi>another Beaſt coming up out of the Earth, and he had two Horns like a Lamb, and he ſpake as a Dragon.</hi> 12. <hi>And he exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt before him, and cauſeth the Earth, and them which dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly Wound was healed.</hi> 13. <hi>And he doth great Wonders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth, in the ſight of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Words we have a very plain and evident Deſcription, both of the <hi>Fccleſiaſtical</hi> Power of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of that <hi>Secular</hi> Power, which they claim by virtue of the other. <hi>I beheld</hi> (ſays <hi>St. John</hi>) <hi>another Beaſt,</hi> that is, another ſort of King or Kingdom than that which is before deſcribed; but yet <hi>he exerciſeth all the Power of that firſt Beaſt before him;</hi> that is, there is no <hi>Power</hi> attributed to that other Beaſt conſiſting
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:38410:190"/>of ten Horns or Kingdoms, but what is <hi>exerciſed</hi> or employed by this two-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Beaſt. Which is as much as to ſay, that this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt is the Head of that <hi>ten-horned</hi> one: for that which <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth all the Power</hi> and Faculties of the Members, is the <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore is called <hi>another</hi> Beaſt from that which is before deſcribed, not in reſpect of the <hi>Head</hi> of it, which is the ſame to both: but in reſpect of its <hi>Horns,</hi> that is, the parts or Kingdoms it conſiſts of. For if we look upon the Popes as <hi>Secular</hi> Heads of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in that reſpect their Kingdom is ſaid to conſiſt of <hi>ten</hi> Kingdoms; becauſe their <hi>Secular</hi> Power is originally inherent in thoſe ten Kings (and their Succeſſors) amongſt whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was divided. But if we look upon them as <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>univerſal Church,</hi> or (as they pleaſe to ſtile themſelves) the <hi>Vicars</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in that reſpect their Kingdom conſiſteth but of <hi>two Horns</hi> or Kingdoms, like the Horns or Kingdoms
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:38410:190"/>of <hi>the Lamb</hi> Chriſt <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by the <hi>Lamb</hi> (a Type, which is ſo often uſed in this Book of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>) is always meant <hi>Chriſt Joſus.</hi> And (as hath been before prov'd) when any Beaſt is repreſented with more than one Horn, it <hi>generally,</hi> if not <hi>conſtantly,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that Kingdom to conſiſt of ſo many Kingdoms as the Beaſt has Horns.</p>
               <p>Now what thoſe two Horns or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, over which the <hi>Lamb</hi> preſideth, are, is manifeſt from this Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For in <hi>Chap.</hi> xv. 3. he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>King of SAINTS,</hi> that is, of his Church and faithful People, and in <hi>Chap.</hi> xvii. 14. he is called <hi>King of KINGS,</hi> that is, of the Secular Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this World. And of <hi>two Horns</hi> or Kingdoms, like theſe Horns or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops (his pretended Vicars) doth conſiſt. For theſe are alſo the Head or King of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> which anſwers to Chriſt's Kingdom of the <hi>Saints:</hi> and withall, they are the Head or King of thoſe ten <hi>Secular</hi> Kings
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:38410:191"/>(with their Succeſſors) who were to <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to them.</hi> And this is the meaning of that which is ſaid of this <hi>other.</hi> Beaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>out of the Earth,</hi> that <hi>he had two Horns like the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that the generality of Interpreters expound theſe <hi>two Horns,</hi> of the Popes <hi>two Powers</hi> of <hi>binding and looſing.</hi> But beſides, that theſe are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but one and the ſame Power, they doe not anſwer to that moſt uſual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Type of <hi>Horns,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are repreſented upon any Beaſt. But let the Reader uſe his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now of this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as having <hi>two Horns like the Lamb,</hi> that is, as pretending to repreſent the Perſon, and to bear the Office of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> upon Earth, by an Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him, it is ſaid, that he came up <hi>out of the Earth,</hi> that is, (as hath bin ſhew'd before) out of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For by the <hi>Earth,</hi> whence this Beaſt is ſaid to have come up, muſt be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:38410:191"/>meant ſome kind of <hi>People:</hi> as by the <hi>Sea</hi> is meant thoſe <hi>Peoples</hi> out of which the former Beaſt aroſe. But there are no <hi>People</hi> concerned in this Prophecy, but only the <hi>Woman,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Multitudes, and Tongues,</hi> on which ſhe ſitteth, and over which ſhe ruleth or preſideth. Since then thoſe <hi>Peoples, Nations, Multitudes, and Tongues,</hi> on which the <hi>Woman</hi> ſitteth, are typified by the <hi>Waters;</hi> there remains no <hi>People</hi> to be typified by the <hi>Earth,</hi> but only the <hi>Woman</hi> her ſelf, that is, the <hi>People</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of this People therefore did this other Beaſt ariſe, who is ſaid to have come up <hi>out of the Earth,</hi> and to <hi>exerciſe all the Power of the firſt Beaſt,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe <hi>out of the Sea.</hi> And we may thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Myſtery of theſe two Beaſts; that the <hi>Head</hi> aroſe out of the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>ten Horns</hi> or Kings, from whom the <hi>Secular</hi> Power of this their <hi>Head</hi> is derived to him, aroſe out of the <hi>Peoples, Multitudes, Nations, and Tongues,</hi> on which, as upon <hi>many Waters
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:38410:192"/>Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> and to the ſubject to her Juriſdiction the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſeen to ſit: and that this <hi>Head,</hi> beſides his <hi>Secular</hi> Power over thoſe ten Kingdoms, hath alſo an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Now of this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt which came up out <hi>of the Earth,</hi> it's ſaid, that <hi>he had two Horns like the Lamb.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the meaning of that be, I am ſure that the Romaniſts neither will nor can deny, but that the Kingdom of their Pontifs has a moſt near and intimate Reſemblance to the Kingdom of Chriſt in all reſpects, as any Antichriſtian Beaſt can have. But, as I ſuppoſe, I have given a ſufficient and clear account of theſe two Horns already: ſo I have nothing more to add, before I proceed to the further Deſcription of this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt, but only to obſerve that he came up out of the ſame ſame Place, where all the ſeven <hi>Heads</hi> or Kings (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the ſeventh or laſt of them, who is called the Beaſt, <hi>that was, and is not,</hi> and hath before been proved to be
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:38410:192"/>the <hi>Biſhops of Rome</hi>) were to ariſe and have their Reſidence. So that there is no one thing of ſmalleſt Moment ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that <hi>Beaſt that was, and is not;</hi> but the ſame is moſt exactly anſwered by the Deſcription of this Beaſt, that is ſaid to have come up out of the Earth.</p>
               <p>For as there it is ſaid of the <hi>Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> that he ſhould ariſe out of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or have his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among the <hi>ſeven Mountains:</hi> ſo here, this Beaſt is ſaid to have come up out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> whereby the ſame Place and People are deſigned. And as there it is ſaid of the <hi>ten Horns,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom,</hi> to the Antichriſtian King, or laſt Head of the Beaſt: ſo here it is ſaid of this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt,</hi> that <hi>he exerciſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt before him,</hi> that is, of the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> which are typified by the ten crowned Horns in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>And the like may be obſerved of all the other Particulars of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's Interpretation, relating to <hi>the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:38410:193"/>ten Kings</hi> there ſpoken of. For there is nothing mentioned of them by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but what is here contained in the Deſcription of theſe <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> that aroſe out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> (the <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>Secul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:38410:195"/>is the Church or City of <hi>Rome,</hi> this gives us further to obſerve the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prophecy of this xiiith, and that of the xviith Chapter of this Book.

                     </gap>ion with her, ver.</hi> 1, 2. ſo here it is noted of the <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>great Whore,</hi> that he is alſo the <hi>Head</hi> of thoſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the <hi>Crowned Horns,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore draws them into like <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Practices with that <hi>great Babylon</hi> his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis. Nay, it is expreſly ſaid of the <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt at <hi>ver.</hi> 6. That he <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed</hi> God, &amp;c. by which (as hath bin ſaid before) is ſignified his <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have obſerved before, that all the Power of that <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt, which <hi>this two-horned Beaſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>exerciſe before him,</hi> is nothing elſe but a Power of ſetting up <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Worſhip, and of <hi>making War againſt the Saints,</hi> and if there be any other <hi>Power</hi> appertaining thereunto. So that by his <hi>exerciſing all the Power of that firſt Beaſt before him,</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:38410:196"/>there is nothing more meant but only, that the ten Kings which conſtitute the Body of the firſt ten-horned Secular Beaſt, are actuated in their <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> or Idolatry, and in their <hi>perſecuting</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> by the Inſtigation and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Eccleſiaſtical <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt. Only let it be here obſerved, that this his <hi>exerciſing all the Power</hi> of that <hi>ten-horned</hi> Beaſt, is directly anſwerable to that which is ſaid of the <hi>ten Horns</hi> or Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 13, 17. <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>they ſhould give their Power, and Strength, and Kingdom</hi> to the ſeventh Head, or laſt King of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is there called <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not.</hi> That Beaſt, I ſay, to whom they <hi>give their Power,</hi> is the ſame with this that <hi>exerciſeth all their Power.</hi> And as we have proved that <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be the <hi>Roman Biſhops:</hi> ſo here we have ſeen that he is deſcribed with <hi>two Horns like the Lamb,</hi> as his pretended Vicar.</p>
               <p>Of whom it is further ſaid, that <hi>he cauſeth the Earth, and them which dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:38410:196"/>deadly Wound was healed.</hi> By the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Power</hi> this <hi>two-horned</hi> Beaſt is ſaid <hi>to excerciſe before him,</hi> is meant <hi>the Leopard;</hi> but by the <hi>firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly Wound was healed,</hi> is meant the <hi>Dragon.</hi> For though the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in reſpect of its <hi>one Body,</hi> be but <hi>one Beaſt;</hi> and ſo there is no difference or diſtinction of <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond:</hi> yet in reſpect of its <hi>many Heads,</hi> it is to be conſider'd as ſo many <hi>Beaſts.</hi> And ſo the Angel conſiders it in his Interpretation, as hath been before proved. Now by the <hi>Beaſt whoſe deadly Wound was healed,</hi> muſt be meant that <hi>Beaſt</hi> which had <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> the deadly Wound. And <hi>that</hi> was the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or the Beaſt under his ſixth Head, the <hi>Roman Heathen Emperours.</hi> In reſpect of whom it is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 3. that <hi>one of the Heads of the Beaſt looked as if it had been wounded to death, and his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wound was healed.</hi> Wherefore it muſt be the <hi>Dragon;</hi> which is meant by the <hi>firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly Wound was healed,</hi> becauſe it is no where ſaid of the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,</hi> (or the Beaſt under his ſeventh
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:38410:197"/>Head) that he <hi>received any Wound</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Dragon</hi> were deſtroyed ere this <hi>two-horned Beaſt</hi> aroſe; how could he <hi>cauſe the Earth, and them that dwell therein, to worſhip</hi> or do homage to <hi>the Dragon?</hi> I anſwer; the <hi>Dragon</hi> is the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> whoſe reigning Power in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire was deſtroyed in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours,</hi> but received in the next ſucceeding <hi>Head,</hi> to whom he <hi>gave</hi> like <hi>power</hi> as he had exerciſed before, when he had the <hi>Emperours</hi> at his Devotion, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 2. and therefore it is ſaid of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> (whoſe Head was this two-horned Beaſt) that <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped</hi> not only <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> but <hi>the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> alſo, <hi>which gave Power unto the</hi> Beaſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. The meaning whereof is, that they obeyed the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in thoſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Laws and Conſtitutions, which though they ſeemed to proceed from his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical two-horned Head,</hi> yet in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who had given him <hi>his Power,</hi> was the prime Author and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of them.</p>
               <p>And as it is there ſaid of the Subjects
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:38410:197"/>of the ten-horned Beaſt, that <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Dragon which gave Power to</hi> him: ſo when it is here noted of the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned Beaſt (the Head of that ten-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one) that <hi>he cauſeth the Inhabiters of the Earth to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly Wound was healed,</hi> that is, the Dragon; the meaning is the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only with an Addition, which gives us to underſtand by what means the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiters of the Earth</hi> were thus ſeduced to the Worſhip of the <hi>Dragon.</hi> For they were moved to it by the Inſtigation and Authority of a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> whom they had little Reaſon to ſuſpect, as having his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and looking like the <hi>Lamb</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. Yet this was he, who <hi>ſpeaking like the Dragon,</hi> did <hi>cauſe the Earth to worſhip</hi> or obey him, and in him the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or the Beaſt, whoſe <hi>deadly Wound was healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the ſence of theſe Words may be expreſt in ſhort to this effect: <hi>viz.</hi> That this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt, though he had <hi>two Horns like the Lamb,</hi> yet acted he the Part of the <hi>Roman Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:38410:198"/>(whoſe <hi>Power, and Seat, and great Authority</hi> he enjoy'd by the Gift and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Dragon,</hi>) cauſing <hi>the Earth and them that dwell therein</hi> (that is, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to worſhip Idols, and to perſecute the Oppoſers of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. And herein alſo the Head of this <hi>Eccleſiaſtical two-horned Beaſt</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the ſame with the Head of the <hi>Secular ten-horned Beaſt,</hi> in that the Subjects of both Kingdoms are ſaid not only to have <hi>worſhipped</hi> or obeyed the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but the <hi>Dragon</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Hitherto have been declared the things which the Pope doth as Head of the <hi>Secular</hi> Power, wherein one of his <hi>Horns</hi> or Kingdoms doth conſiſt: As ſuch, <hi>he ſpeaketh like a Dragon; he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth all the Power of the firſt Beaſt before him;</hi> he cauſeth the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church <hi>to worſhip the Dragon.</hi> Which is no more than what is ſaid of the Head of the ten-horned Secular Beaſt: and conſequently it belongs to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> as Head of that ten horned Beaſt. For neither is it any other Power
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:38410:198"/>than what the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had exerciſed before. But in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. we have a Deſcription of the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Power</hi> of this two-horned Beaſt. For there it is added, that <hi>he doth great Wonders, ſo that he maketh Fire come down from Heaven on the Earth, in the ſight of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope's <hi>Excommunications</hi> are here ſet forth under the Notion of <hi>great Wonders:</hi> not that they are <hi>real and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Miracles,</hi> but that they are very <hi>ſtrange and wonderful</hi> things. And ſuch indeed as even without a Trope or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor may be call'd <hi>great Signs</hi> or Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: at leaſt, there cannot be an eaſier or leſs ſtrained Metaphor to expreſs the nature of them by.</p>
               <p>For we muſt not look that any thing in this Prophecy ſhould be ſet forth to us in Words of plain and literal Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; there being hardly any Verſe, or Clauſe of any Verſe in all this Book, containing any thing of Prophecy in it, which is not full of Metaphors, Types, and Figures. So that, of the two, the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:38410:199"/>
                  <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Senſe of any Word (if it does not ſeem <hi>affected,</hi> nor <hi>incongruous</hi>) ſhould rather be admitted than the <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> And therefore in my Judgment, we ought rather to look upon theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>great Signs</hi> or Wonders, as a <hi>figurative</hi> Expreſſion, than a <hi>literal.</hi> But I believe we ſhall find no <hi>figurative</hi> ſence of the Words, more naturally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to them, than that of very <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>wonderful things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for a further Confirmation of this Expoſition, let us look back to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. where it cannot be denied, but that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in her Primitive Purity, is repreſented as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>great Sign</hi> or Wonder; and at <hi>ver.</hi> 3. the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church, are ſet forth as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>another Wonder.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that, as it would be a real <hi>Wonder</hi> to ſee a <hi>Great Red Dragon in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a Woman cloathed with the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. perſecuted by that Dragon, and overcoming him: ſo both the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were very
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:38410:199"/>much to be admir'd of all Men; the one for their outragious Cruelty, the other for her Innocence, and Purity, and patient ſuffering. So here the <hi>Earthly Beaſt</hi> is ſaid to do <hi>great Signs</hi> or Wonders: that is, not real proper Miracles, but ſuch kind of Wonders as the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> were, to wit, things very ſtrange and wonderful.</p>
               <p>But becauſe theſe very <hi>ſtrange and Wonderful things are</hi> thought fit to be expreſſed by <hi>great Signs</hi> or <hi>Wonders;</hi> therefore to carry on the Metaphor, the things themſelves are repreſented and deſcribed, (as before in <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. ſo here again) as if they were indeed true, real, proper Signs and Wonders. And we have two Inſtances of the wonderful Works of this Beaſt, One is, his <hi>making Fire come down from Heaven:</hi> the other is, his <hi>cauſing an Image to be made, and giving life to it, that the Image could both ſpeak, and vindicate its own Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his <hi>making Fire come down from Heaven,</hi> I know not what it can more fitly be applied to then the Pope's
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:38410:200"/>
                  <hi>Bulls</hi> of Excommunication. Nay I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I may challenge the greateſt Wit in the World to expreſs the wonderful Power of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Excommunications, by a more natural and ſignificant Allegory, than that which is here uſed. Certainly <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who was as great a Maſter of Eloquence, and as excellent in this very way of <hi>figurative</hi> Expreſſions, as perhaps was ever any in the World; (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth both by his other Writings, and particularly by his Book of Proverbs:) though he thought not in the leaſt of this Prophecy, yet having occaſion to repreſent a <hi>Perſon excommunicated</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> he could not think of any neater Type or Metaphor, than this of <hi>Fire from Heaven.</hi> And becauſe this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor ſeemed to him ſo ſit and natural, he dwells upon it a long while together. This is to be found in his Dialogue, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Inquiſitio de Fide,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; where he makes this Diſcourſe between <hi>Aulus</hi> and <hi>Barbatius,</hi> which I will here ſet down, that the Reader who
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:38410:200"/>has any opinion of <hi>Eraſmus's</hi> Eloquence, may ſee how properly the Pope's <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications</hi> are repreſented by <hi>Fire from Heaven.</hi> His Words in Engliſh are to this Effect:</p>
               <p>Au. <hi>It is the Children's ſong, Salute wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: but I know not whether I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay, Save you, or not,</hi> Bar. <hi>Truly I had rather one ſhould give me health, than ſay it to me. But why doeſt thou ſay this,</hi> Aulus? Au. <hi>Why! Becauſe, if you would know, you ſmell of Brimſtone, or the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Bolt of Jupiter.</hi> Bar. <hi>There are right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aiming Thunder-Bolts, and there are Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts that fly at all adventures, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much even in their Original from ſuch as are deſigned, and portend Miſchief. For, as I ſuſpect, you ſpeak, of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Au. <hi>You ſay right, I do.</hi> Bar. <hi>Truly I heard horrid Thundring, but I felt not the Stroke of the Thunder-bolt.</hi> Au. <hi>How ſo?</hi> Bar. <hi>Becauſe I have as good a Stomack to my Meat, and ſleep as quietly as before.</hi> Au. <hi>But that Miſchief which is not perceived, is wont to be the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Yet ſurely theſe brute random-Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:38410:201"/>as you call them, ſtrike the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the Seas.</hi> Bar. <hi>They ſtrike, but to no purpoſe. There is alſo Lightning ſent out of a Glaſſe, or braſen Veſſel.</hi> Au. <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly even this were enough to frighten one.</hi> Bar. <hi>To frighten Children. But there is none but God that has a Thunder-bolt to ſtrike the Soul withall.</hi> Au. <hi>What if God be in his Vicar?</hi> Bar. <hi>I would he were.</hi> Au. <hi>Truly there are many wonder that you are not long ſince grown blacker then any coal.</hi> Bar. <hi>Suppoſe I were, you ought ſo much the rather to wiſh Health to a loſt Man; for ſo the Goſpel teacheth us.</hi> Au. <hi>It is to be wiſhed indeed, but not ſpoken.</hi> Bar. <hi>Why ſo?</hi> Au. <hi>That the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriken Perſon might be aſhamed, and repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much <hi>Eraſmus</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. From whence I think it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear, (which is the only thing that I produc'd it for) that the Popes <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications</hi> may very fitly be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>Fire from Heaven.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if there be nothing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-uſe of this Metaphor to contradict
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:38410:201"/>this Explication, I ſuppoſe I have given a reaſonable Account of it. But the Scripture is ſo far from contradicting this Explication, that it ſeems rather to confirm it.</p>
               <p>For this <hi>making Fire to come down from Heaven,</hi> what Scripture-paſſage can it have relation to, if not to that of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.10.) and to that of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, (Luke</hi> ix. 54.) who in a like Zeal to that of <hi>Elias,</hi> would have <hi>commanded Fire to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and conſume</hi> their Adverſaries? ſince therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> thunders out his <hi>Bulls</hi> of Excommunication againſt his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries with like fervent <hi>Zeal,</hi> and in the cauſe of <hi>Religion</hi> too, repreſenting as near as can be the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and of theſe two <hi>Boanerges, James</hi> and <hi>John, the Sons of Thunder,</hi> in that Action of commanding <hi>Fire from Heaven,</hi> Mark iii. 17. (though in a cauſe as different from theirs, as Heaven and Earth are diſtant) why may we not think, that what the Pope thus doth in Imitation, as it were, of that great Prophet, and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:38410:202"/>the two Diſciples, ſhould be expreſt by an alluſion to them? For when the Pope is angry, he would bring down as real Fire from Heaven, as did the Prophet, or as the Diſciples meant to do: but wanting power to bring down <hi>real</hi> Fire, he muſt content himſelf with <hi>Metaphorical.</hi> And thus much of the firſt of the <hi>great Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> that this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt is ſaid to do, to <hi>wit,</hi> His <hi>making Fire to come down from Heaven upon the Earth</hi> (the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church) <hi>in the ſight of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other <hi>great Sign</hi> or <hi>Wonder,</hi> to wit, that of the <hi>Image,</hi> follows in the next two verſes. 14. <hi>And he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth, by the means of thoſe Miracles which he had Power to do in the ſight of the Beaſt, ſaying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they ſhould make an Image to the Beaſt, which had the Wound by a Sword, and did live;</hi> 15. <hi>And he had Power to give life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beast ſhould both ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:38410:202"/>of the Beast, ſhould be killed.</hi> This is ſuch a <hi>Miracle</hi> as the other was; I mean, a very <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> thing. And being called a <hi>Miracle,</hi> it is <hi>deſcribed</hi> likewiſe as a Miracle. But the Miracle is indeed no more but this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Pope had ſo much Power and Influence both on <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that he could make another <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
               <p>This power and reputation he had gotten by deceiving the Church, by the means of thoſe great things which he pretended to. And it is obſervable, that as he is ſaid to have done the former Miracle <hi>in the ſight of Men</hi> in general; So this latter Miracle is ſet down as an inſtance of thoſe great and wonderful things, which he doth <hi>in the ſight of the Beast,</hi> (that is, of thoſe the Kings before deſcribed,) to gain himſelf the greater Honour, Reverence, and Obſervance from them.</p>
               <p>He <hi>ſaith</hi> therefore <hi>to them that dwell on the Earth,</hi> (that is, to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) that <hi>they ſhould make an Image to
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:38410:203"/>the Beast, that had the Wound by a Sword, and did live.</hi> Now the Beaſt which had the Wound by a Sword and did live, was the Beaſt under his ſixth Head, the <hi>Roman Heathen Emperors,</hi> of whom it is ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. 11. that <hi>Michael and his Angels overcame them by the Sword of their Teſtimony.</hi> And this is the <hi>Wound</hi> which was given to that Beaſt by the <hi>Sword,</hi> to wit, <hi>by the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, Epheſ.</hi> vi. 17. And this Beaſt which is typified by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and had the wound by the Sword of God's Spirit, recovered of his deadly Wound, and revived under a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head, to whom the <hi>Dragon gave his Power, and Seat, and great Authority.</hi> Neither is there any other Beaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in this Prophecy, that had a wound by any Sword, and lived, beſides the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or <hi>Rome's Heathen Emperors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe <hi>Emperors</hi> therefore it is that this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt gives order to the <hi>Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> to make an <hi>Image</hi> or Reſemblance. Which in plam words amounts to this, That the Biſhop

               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had not wherewithal to make this <hi>new</hi> elected Emperor as conſiderable as the <hi>old,</hi> nor was there any Perſon to be choſen, that for the vaſtneſs of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and extent of Empire, could any ways deſerve the Name of <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> (which is a Title and Expreſſion of the moſt excellent of all Secular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:) therefore is this <hi>new Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> called here an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>old,</hi> as being the Patron of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> like thoſe <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi> and perſecuting the true Servants of God, as they did; and as being adorned with all their glorious <hi>Titles, Banner, Crown,</hi> and <hi>Robe Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and ſaluted by the Name of <hi>Roman Emperour, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> but yet if we look upon the thing wherein the

               <p>And this, I hope, is ſufficient to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Application of this Metaphor to the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances of this Prophecy ſhall be found to anſwer thereunto. For they were <hi>made</hi> by the <hi>Pope, elected</hi> by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:38410:205"/>the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> by the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they are ſaluted <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and the Pope confers upon them the <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> with other Ornaments and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages; and yet when all is done, they are no better than a mere <hi>Image</hi> or a <hi>Shadow</hi> of that mighty Name, <hi>A ROMAN EMPERO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But poſſibly ſome may think that this <hi>Image</hi> was a kind of an <hi>enchanted</hi> Image, becauſe it is added, <hi>that he</hi> (that is, the two-horned Beaſt) <hi>had Power to give Life to the Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beaſt ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the Beaſt, ſhould be killed.</hi> But if this <hi>Image</hi> had been made of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or any other like materials, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it would have paſt the Power of Enchantment, to have given it theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that are here aſcribed to it. For this <hi>Image</hi> is deſcribed, not only like a <hi>living Man,</hi> but like a <hi>King:</hi> for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> and the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>worſhipped,</hi> are, as they are uſed in this Prophecy, appropriated unto Beaſts
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:38410:205"/>or <hi>Kings.</hi> But if this <hi>Image</hi> had been made of <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no greater Perfection from the Hands of the two-horned Artificer, than only <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> and anſwerable faculties like a living <hi>Man;</hi> and had this <hi>Life,</hi> this <hi>Speech,</hi> and other faculties bin as <hi>real,</hi> as all the other Paſſages of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy are <hi>metaphorical:</hi> I ſee not how we can admit this <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> to have been made by virtue of <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> without aſcribing to the <hi>Maker</hi> of it an incommunicable Attribute of the <hi>Great Greatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe therefore that we muſt of neceſſity underſtand theſe faculties of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> himſelf, in a Metaphorical and Improper Senſe. And ſo it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree exactly to thoſe <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> of whom I have interpreted this <hi>Image of the Beaſt.</hi> For theſe as <hi>Men</hi> &amp; <hi>Kings</hi> of God's appointment, had <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> and <hi>Regal Power</hi> before. But if we look upon them as the <hi>Image of the Beaſt,</hi> or as <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours ordained
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:38410:206"/>by the Pope to thoſe intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes afore recited; in that reſpect it may be truly ſaid, and almoſt <hi>properly;</hi> without a figure, that the Pope, which made him <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, did alſo give him <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> and <hi>Power Imperial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that in this verſe, tho the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> be the only ſubject of it, yet is he not left to be underſtood in any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (as <hi>he,</hi> or <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>it,</hi> or any other) but the <hi>Image of the Beast</hi> is as oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as there was occaſion to ſpeak of him. For it is ſaid that <hi>he</hi> (the two-horned Beaſt) <hi>gave life to the</hi> Image of the Beaſt, that the Image of the Beaſt <hi>ſhould both ſpeak, and cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the</hi> Image <hi>of the</hi> Beaſt, <hi>ſhould bek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:38410:206"/>and no otherwiſe. For, as <hi>Kings,</hi> they had the ſame before, without any obligation to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this making of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who has no greater honour than that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who never did pretend to any Worldly Dignity above a <hi>Fiſher-Man,</hi> may well be thought a very <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> attempt: it is therefore here prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically repreſented as a <hi>Miracle.</hi> And the rather, becauſe this Beaſt, whoſe Kingdom is repreſented with <hi>two Horns like the Lambs,</hi> might alſo ſeem to have ſome likeneſs to him in his <hi>Works.</hi> Hence it is that his <hi>Excommunications</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed as a <hi>Miracle,</hi> and here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain his <hi>making of a Roman Emperor</hi> is ſet forth to us, as if he made an <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> and had Power to give the Image <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> and <hi>Regal</hi> Majeſty and Authority. But the plain meaning of it is no more but this: That the preſent race of <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, if we conſider them as <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:38410:207"/>as Elected, Crowned, Dignified, and Conſtituted by the <hi>Pope's</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be the Patrons of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition: is wholly influenced, actuated and inſpired by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and has no <hi>Life,</hi> nor <hi>Speech,</hi> nor <hi>Power Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial,</hi> but what it has received from him. And thus we have an account of the two <hi>Horns</hi> or Kingdoms of this Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Beaſt, to wit, his <hi>Secular</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his <hi>Spiritual;</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Power</hi> he exerciſeth in reſpect of both.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore ſee in the next place, what Perſons this his Eccleſiaſtical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth conſiſt of. In reſpect of his <hi>Secular</hi> Kingdom, he is ſaid at <hi>ver.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to have Power given him <hi>over all Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</hi> But in reſpect of his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Kingdom, his Subjects are peculiarly diſtinguiſhed by a certain <hi>Mark</hi> or Character, which he cauſeth them to receive. For ſo it follows at <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>that he cauſeth all</hi> (to wit, all that dwell on the Earth, whence he himſelf deriveth his Original, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and who alone are mentioned afterwards, as the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:38410:207"/>Subjects of his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Kingdom; all theſe, I ſay) <hi>both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a Mark in their right Hand, or in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> 17. <hi>And that no Man might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the Mark, or the Name of the Beaſt, or the Number of his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an antient cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſet a Mark upon their <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> and their <hi>Servants,</hi> that it might be known to what <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>Servants,</hi> and to what <hi>General</hi> the <hi>Souldiers</hi> did belong. The <hi>Servants</hi> uſually received this <hi>Mark</hi> in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> and the <hi>Souldiers</hi> in their <hi>Hands.</hi> To this Cuſtom there is a manifeſt Alluſion, both here in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Subjects of this <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> Beaſt, and alſo in that of the <hi>Lamb's</hi> ſelected Company, <hi>Chap.</hi> vii. at the beginning. By conſidering of which, as we ſhall eaſily underſtand what the <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Number of the Name,</hi> which that Company of the <hi>Lamb</hi> received, are: ſo by comparing them with this <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the Beaſt, and of the Subjects of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:38410:208"/>his Kingdom, which is oppoſite to the <hi>Lamb's,</hi> we ſhall as eaſily perceive the meaning of theſe alſo.</p>
               <p>Now in that viith Chapter the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of God are ſaid to have been <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Foreheads.</hi> And being there repreſented as <hi>Jews</hi> (a very uſual thing in this Prophecy for the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church to be deſcribed by Types and Figures borrowed from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>) they are ſaid to have been <hi>ſealed twelve thouſand of each Tribe.</hi> So that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of them conſiſted of twelve times twelve thouſand, and were in all <hi>one hundred forty four thouſand.</hi> Now it is manifeſt that theſe were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which are here ſaid to have been <hi>ſealed;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are affirmed afterwards to have been <hi>followers of the Lamb, Chap.</hi> xiv. 1, 4.</p>
               <p>And it is as manifeſt that by the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> are meant the <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> which were planted by the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For if we underſtand the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> literally, we muſt underſtand the <hi>ſealing</hi> and the <hi>numbers,</hi> and all other
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:38410:208"/>things thereto relating, nay, and the whole Prophecy of the Revelation, in a <hi>literal</hi> ſence; unleſs there can be any ſpecial reaſon offer'd from the Context, why theſe twelve Tribes alone muſt be expounded in a <hi>literal</hi> ſence. But till this ſpecial Reaſon be produced (for I know not any yet) I muſt expound them <hi>figuratively,</hi> namely of twelve <hi>Christian</hi> Tribes, deducing their original from the twelve Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And this as I conceive to be a very pertinent and moſt obvious Expoſition: ſo hence we may perceive what is the meaning of this number <hi>Twelve,</hi> which all thoſe <hi>ſeuled</hi> ones are ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for they are ſealed by <hi>Twelve thouſand</hi> of a Tribe. For hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that this number <hi>Twelve,</hi> which is ſo viſible and conſpicuous in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> is only uſed as a Type of their <hi>Original</hi> from the twelve Apoſtles, &amp; the Churches of their found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which embraced and continued in the Truth and Purity of their Doctrin.</p>
               <p>And we may further ſee that this
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:38410:209"/>number <hi>Twelve</hi> is properly the number of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> in that it ſhineth ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly in every thing belonging to him. For ſo the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> alſo is deſcribed, <hi>Chap.</hi> xxi. as having <hi>Twelve</hi> Gates, <hi>Twelve</hi> Angels at the Gates, <hi>Twelve</hi> Names, <hi>Twelve</hi> Foundations, <hi>Twelve</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and as containing <hi>Twelve</hi> thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand furlongs of cubical meaſure; and the Wall of it <hi>twelve</hi> times <hi>twelve</hi> Cub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, or one hundred forty four Cubits. Which to me is as evident a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the nature of the thing will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that <hi>Twelve</hi> is the <hi>Lambs</hi> number; and that it is uſed typically in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to denote the <hi>Original</hi> of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and his holy City from the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles,</hi> as conſiſting of ſuch Perſons, who continue in the Truth and Purity of their Doctrine and Religion.</p>
               <p>And from hence it will follow, that the <hi>Number of the Beaſt</hi> is a certain Number anſwerable to this <hi>Number of the Lamb,</hi> a number which the Beaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects above all other Numbers, which is moſt conſpicuous in his Kingdom, and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:38410:209"/>which his Company is here ſaid to have received as deſcending from him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from <hi>Great Babylon</hi> his Metropolis, who is called the <hi>Mother of Harlots.</hi> Which <hi>Harlots,</hi> or Idolatrous Churches, deſcending from their Mother <hi>Babylon,</hi> are typically repreſented by ſuch as have received the <hi>number of the Beaſt,</hi> in token of their vile and baſe <hi>Original.</hi> And what this <hi>Number</hi> is, and how it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Kingdom of the Beaſt, we ſhall hear anon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, let it only be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That this <hi>Number,</hi> which is here called the <hi>Number of the Beaſt's Name,</hi> is in the very next verſe called <hi>the Number of the Beaſt.</hi> For it is a Number anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of <hi>Twelve,</hi> whereby the Kingdom of the Beaſt, or the Company of thoſe who have received his <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Name,</hi> are myſtically repreſented, in like manner as the Company of the <hi>Lamb</hi> are ſaid to have bin <hi>ſealed with his Fathers Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore let us enquire what this <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> of the Beaſt

                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſeemeth to pleaſe himſelf very much, in that no Man can diſcover what the <hi>Name</hi> of the Beaſt is. For thence he would infer that <hi>Antichriſt is not yet come,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Name</hi> is undiſcovered. But this <hi>Name</hi> of the Beaſt is not ſo much in the dark, as he ſeems to make it. For the <hi>Name</hi> of the Beaſt is written out at length, and that in characters of the largeſt ſize, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 5. And his <hi>Name</hi> is this, which is written upon his <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as he is the <hi>Head</hi> of his Metropolis, MISTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. This <hi>Name</hi> is ſaid to have bin written on the <hi>Forehead</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And being written on her <hi>Forehead,</hi> it muſt be on her <hi>Head,</hi> whereof the Forehead is a part. And ſince this Eccleſiaſtical Beaſt is the <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>Woman,</hi> this <hi>Name</hi> muſt have bin written upon <hi>hint</hi> and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:38410:210"/>conſequently this <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>his;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is that very <hi>Name of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> which was ſeen upon the ſeventh Head or King of <hi>Rome:</hi> for the ſeven-headed Beaſt was <hi>full of Names of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Rev.</hi> xvii. 3. and theſe <hi>Names</hi> were written on his <hi>Heads, Rev.</hi> xiii. 1. Wherefore that <hi>Name</hi> which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the Woman's Forehead, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. where ſhe is deſcrib'd ſitting upon the Beaſt under his ſeventh Head, is the Name of the Beaſt under his ſeventh Head, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Antichriſtian Beaſt. And thus we have, as I conceive, a plain diſcovery of the <hi>Name</hi> of this Beaſt.</p>
               <p>Now as for his <hi>Mark,</hi> it is the ſame thing with his <hi>Name;</hi> that is, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are <hi>marked</hi> with his <hi>Name.</hi> This <hi>Name,</hi> which is inſcribed on his Forehead, he makes his Subjects to receive. And therefore the Name that is written on his Forehead, bears ſo manifeſt a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Church or People, whom he cauſeth to receive the ſame. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of <hi>him</hi> alone, that he is <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:38410:211"/>the Great,</hi> but only in relation to his <hi>Church.</hi> To which purpoſe it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that this Name is ſaid to have been written not on <hi>his</hi> Forehead, but on the <hi>Woman's.</hi> For though <hi>his</hi> Forehead, and the <hi>Woman's</hi> be the ſame (he being the Woman's Head:) yet when it is ſaid to have been written on the <hi>Womans</hi> Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it gives us to underſtand that it is no otherwiſe <hi>his</hi> Name, than as the <hi>Head</hi> of his Idolatrous Metropolis.</p>
               <p>But yet we muſt not look upon this <hi>Name</hi> of him, or of his Church, as being the <hi>proper Name</hi> whereby they ſhould be uſually known and called: but only as a Name impoſed on them, to denote their Superſtition and Idolatry. And this in Scripture is a very uſual thing. For ſo it is foretold of Chriſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> ix. 6, that he ſhould <hi>be called Wonderful, Counſellour,</hi> &amp;c. And of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> Iſa. 1.26. <hi>That ſhe ſhould be called the City of Righteouſneſs, the faithful City.</hi> Which is directly oppoſite to this Name of the Antichriſtian City, <hi>Myſtery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:38410:211"/>of the Earth.</hi> And as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> are marked with his <hi>Name:</hi> ſo the ſelected Company of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> are ſaid to have had his Father's <hi>Name</hi> upon their Foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 1. they therefore were ſealed or <hi>marked</hi> with the Father's <hi>Name:</hi> whereby no more is to be underſtood, but that they were his <hi>Servants.</hi> But hence alſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the oppoſite <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of the Beaſt are all one; and that they who had his <hi>Name</hi> had his <hi>Mark</hi> alſo; or, that they were <hi>marked</hi> with his <hi>Name.</hi> And for a further Confirmation hereof, we may obſerve, by comparing the 9th and 11th verſes of the xivth Chap. of this Book together, that the <hi>Mark of the Beaſt</hi> is called <hi>the Mark of his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence then it appears what Perſons are peculiarly deſigned by thoſe whom the Beaſt cauſeth to receive the <hi>Mark</hi> of his <hi>Name.</hi> For this <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Name</hi> was ſeen upon the Fore-head of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> The <hi>Woman</hi> therefore, or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are here peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by this Type. That Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:38410:212"/>conſiſts of two ſorts of Perſons. The one, are ſuch as have received this Mark in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> as the <hi>Servants</hi> of the Beaſt: the other, ſuch as have received it in there <hi>Hands,</hi> as being his <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and Propugners of his Superſtition. The firſt may be interpreted the <hi>Laity,</hi> who have received this Mark in their <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads:</hi> the other the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who have received it in their <hi>Hands</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>And hence alſo it appears who they are that are ſaid to have received the <hi>Number of his Name.</hi> For they are ſuch as hold with <hi>Rome</hi> in her Idolatry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving the <hi>Original</hi> of their Superſtition from her, and are deſigned by thoſe <hi>naughty Women</hi> called <hi>Harlots</hi> (or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Churches) whoſe <hi>Mother</hi> that <hi>Great Babylon</hi> is ſaid to be. So that theſe Churches alſo have received the ſame <hi>Name</hi> &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> as being guilty of the ſame Idolatry: but they are ſaid more <hi>properly</hi> to have receiv'd the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Name,</hi> to ſignify withal from whence they are deſcended, or that they have their Superſtition from the Church
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:38410:212"/>of <hi>Rome.</hi> For ſo the Company of the Lamb are ſeal'd by <hi>twelves,</hi> and ſo receive the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name,</hi> to ſhew they are the genuine <hi>offspring</hi> of the 12 <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it is added of this Beaſt, that he cauſeth, that <hi>no Man ſhould buy or ſell, ſave he that had the Mark or Name of the Beaſt, or the Number of his Name;</hi> the meaning is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicteth the faithful Servants of God the commerce of the reſt of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, forbidding any man to <hi>buy</hi> ought of them, or <hi>ſell</hi> ought to them.

                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:38410:213"/>Here is a Number given us to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and to encourage us thereunto, we are told, that <hi>it is the Number of a Man,</hi> that is, not a Seraphick Number, which poſſibly Men cannot count; but ſuch a Number as is uſed by Man, and ſuch as Men are wont to count. Now if you give an Arithmetician a ſingle Number to count or calculate, he has no way of counting it but by extracting the Root of it: and if no Root be mentioned, the <hi>Square Root</hi> is always meant. And if we thus calculate the Number, ſix hundred ſixty ſix, we ſhall find the Square Root of it, (ſo near as it can be expreſt in number) to be twenty five.</p>
               <p>Which Number twenty five in the Kingdom of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is anſwerable to the number twelve in the Kingdom of the <hi>Lamb:</hi> and is applicable to all thoſe oppoſite things in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, to which the number twelve is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually applyed by the Holy Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the <hi>new Jeruſalem.</hi> For as the new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is ſaid (<hi>Rev.</hi> xxi.) to have had <hi>Twelve Gates, and at the Gates Twelve
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:38410:214"/>Angels, and Names written thereon, which are the Names of the Twelve Tribes of the Children of Iſrael; and the Wall of the City to have had Twelve Foundations, and in them the Names of the Twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb; and as the Cubical Meaſure of the City is ſaid to have bin Twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Furlongs; the Length and the Breadth and the Height of it</hi> being <hi>equal,</hi> &amp;c. So the Number twenty five in theſe reſpects and many more is applicable to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> Papal, as is admirably ſhewed by Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> in his excellent Treatiſe of the <hi>Number</hi> ſix hundred ſixty ſix. To which for brevity ſake I muſt refer the Reader: it being the only Subject of a juſt Volume to clear the Myſtery of that Number.</p>
               <p>And he ſheweth there, that the firſt eſtabliſht and decreed Number of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> (anſwerable to the twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) was twenty five; and that they had twenty five <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> to officiat in, that <hi>Rome</hi> had twenty five <hi>Gates,</hi> &amp;c. with many other things wherein this number twenty five is moſt notoriouſly
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:38410:214"/>obſervable in the City and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than in any other Church or City, and more than any other <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in that Church or City. His Book is very well worth the reading to any one that is deſirous of Satisfaction in this Myſterie. For in my Opinion he does not only give a ſolid and ſubſtantial, but a wonderful Account of it: but I know not how another Man may be affected with it. And now having done with what concerns this Eccleſiaſtical two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned Beaſt, I ſhall here ſubjoyn this ſhort Paraphraſe, according to my uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al method.</p>
               <p>Paraphraſe on Rev. XIII.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And I beheld another Beaſt or King coming up out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Kingdom conſiſted of two Kingdoms (a <hi>Secular</hi> and an <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> Kingdom) like the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> but he iſſued out Idolatrous Laws, and cruel Edicts againſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants of God, like as the <hi>Roman Heathen Emperours</hi> had done before him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And this King, as the Head of the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:38410:215"/>Kings that ſhared the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire amongſt them, exerciſeth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth all their Power of perſecuting the Saints, they doing it by his Impulſe and direction; and he does it in their Sight, and with their Approbation, for they <hi>give their Power and Strength and Kingdom</hi> to him for this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And thus he acteth the part of thoſe <hi>Roman Heathen Emperours,</hi> in cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to obey him in his Idolatrous Conſtitutions, and bloody Edicts for the perſecuting of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And he doth very ſtrange and wonderful things, in the open Face of the Church, which cauſe great Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in all beholders. For in his way he hath much of <hi>Elias,</hi> being as zealous for his Idolatry, as that good Prophet was in the ſervice of the true God: thundring out his Buls of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as if he brought down Fire from Heaven, againſt all Perſons whatſoever, (Kings and Emperours not excepted) that oppoſe his Superſtition.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:38410:215"/>14. And by the means of theſe great things that he pretends to, he deceiveth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and carrieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Lord Paramount amongſt them, in ſo much that by Vertue of his own Authority he takes upon him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Romans</hi> to elect another <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperour,</hi> which, like the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> of old, ſhould patronize the Superſtitions and Idolatries of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And this <hi>Image</hi> of thoſe antient Emperors (for the new-elected Emperor is no more, if we reſpect the Power and Majeſty of that great Name) this King that came up out of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> inſpired and gave Life to. For it <hi>ſpake</hi> as he directed, and cauſed all his Subjects under pain of death, to obey him as an <hi>Image</hi> of the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, and <hi>Protector</hi> of the modern <hi>Romiſh</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And further, this Eccleſiaſtical King, in token of his Supremacy in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, cauſeth them all, both ſmall and great, rich and poor, free and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:38410:216"/>bond, to receive a <hi>Mark</hi> of Servitude and Subjection to him; that ſome ſhould be to propagate and maintain his Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all ſhould practiſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And that no Man ſhould <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>ſell,</hi> or ſhould have any civil Commerce with his Citizens, but only thoſe that had received this Mark of Subjection to him in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or were at leaſt of ſome other Church profeſſing his Religion, and deriving the Original of their Superſtitious Worſhip from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Followers, and Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Here is Wiſdom. Let him that hath Underſtanding extract the Square Root of the Number of this King, for it is ſuch a Number as Men uſe to calculate, and the Number is ſix hundred ſixty ſix: which Number in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is anſwerable to the Number, one hundred forty four, in the Church of Chriſt: and the ſquare Root of it, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five, is oppoſite to the Number twelve, and as conſpicuous in the Church of

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>Thus, Reader, have I given an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of that Hypotheſis, which I had before proved out of the Angel's Interpretation, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. And this was all that I deſigned; and more perhaps than was abſolutely neceſſary for my purpoſe, which was only the Diſcovery of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> For it is certain, that the <hi>Beaſt that was and is not,</hi> who is deſcribed by the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. is <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> for it is he to whom the <hi>ten Kings,</hi> that <hi>make War with the Lamb,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>give their Power and Strength and Kingdom.</hi> Since therefore the Angel tels us that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the eighth King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one of the ſeven Kings that are typified by the ſeven blaſphemous Heads, there was no more neceſſary to be done in order to the Diſcovery of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> than to ſhew the meaning of the Angel's Words, and who that Eighth King is.</p>
            <p>And this if I have not demonſtrated
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:38410:217"/>from the Angel's Interpretation, before I came to the xiith and xiiith Chapters, (which have no ſuch Divine Expoſitor to give light to them, but only what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects from the xviith Chapter) I believe I have not done it at all. Nay, I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Opinion, that it is impoſſible to give a clear and undeniable Expoſition of any Prophecy in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> till firſt that Expoſition which the Angel gives us in the xviith Chapter be diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, and fully cleared, and rightly apprehended. And that otherwiſe the beſt Interpretation that any Man can give us of theſe Myſteries, can be no better than a Probable Conjecture, an Argument of the Author's Wit or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may ſerve to <hi>pleaſe</hi> the <hi>Fancy,</hi> but not to <hi>edify</hi> the <hi>Judgment,</hi> or to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of the underſtanding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But having firſt well grounded the deſign upon the Angel's Expoſition in the xviith Chapter, and from thence proceeding to ſuch other Viſions, as have the neareſt Correſpondence and Affinity with that, and thence to others in like
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:38410:217"/>order. I am perſwaded, that by ſuch a Method of interpreting, the <hi>Revelation</hi> may be made as eaſie and intelligible, not only as any other <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but as any other <hi>Book</hi> of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But it was not my purpoſe to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with the whole Prophecy of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it being ſufficient for the Deſignation of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to aſſert and clear the meaning of the Angel's Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And having done this to the beſt of my Abilities, I hope that what I have <hi>well meant</hi> will be <hi>pardoned</hi> by all, and what I have <hi>ill performed</hi> will be <hi>mended</hi> by ſome better hand. But had I given never ſo clear an account of the Angel's Interpretation in the xvii Chapter, yet I ſuppoſed it might be neither unpleaſant nor unprofitable to the Reader, to give a taſte of that Hypotheſis in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome other Viſions. For though a proof be never ſo direct and evident in it ſelf, yet by concurrent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it may be much confirmed and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated. And for this Reaſon I have paſſed from the xviith Chapter to the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:38410:218"/>xiith and xiiith Chapters, expounding them by that Hypotheſis which I dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the xviith Chapter. And let the Reader judge how naturally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcedly the Expoſition of thoſe xiith and xiiith Chapters hath proceeded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>I have nothing more to add upon this Subject, but only to give the Reader notice, that as the fate of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is deſcribed to us in that of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo <hi>all other Churches</hi> in communion with her, muſt be conceiv'd as repreſented by like Types and Figures. My meaning is, that as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is typified by a <hi>Woman;</hi> ſo we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>all other Churches</hi> in communion with her, to be typified by <hi>Women</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. As where it is ſaid of the Company of the <hi>Lamb, Rev.</hi> xiv. 4. <hi>that they were not defiled with Women;</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>Women,</hi> ſuch Women as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, who is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Mother of Harlots,</hi> that is, of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Churches. And ſo likewiſe as we find the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is typified by
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:38410:218"/>the <hi>Earth,</hi> we muſt conceive the ſame op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Type to be accommodable to <hi>all other Churches</hi> in communion with her, according as the Scope and Context of the place we find it in, ſhall determin the Expoſitor's Judgment. For the Type of <hi>Earth</hi> is not a proper Deſignation of any <hi>Place,</hi> but of the Catholick Churches <hi>Earthy and</hi> Degenerate, in oppoſition to her <hi>Heavenly</hi> State. Wherefore <hi>all other Churches,</hi> that are guilty of the like Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy with that of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be comprehended in the ſame Type, which ſets out to us the Degeneracy of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that in general ſpeaking, the <hi>Roman Catholick Church</hi> is repreſented to us by the <hi>Earth;</hi> and by the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Civil State;</hi> and by the <hi>Kings of the Earth,</hi> are meant the Kings that held communion with <hi>the Church of Rome;</hi> and by <hi>the Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> are meant the <hi>People</hi> of the ſame Communion. And becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire have ever ſince the Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt Period (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the firſt
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:38410:219"/>Chriſtian Emperour) been ſo united and confederated, that the <hi>Common People</hi> ſeem to belong as much to one as to the other: therefore, as I conceive, it will be moſt agreeable to right Reaſon, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>the Earth</hi> of <hi>Church-men</hi> moſt eſpecially, and ſuch as are devoted to Religion; and <hi>the Sea,</hi> of <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> and ſuch as are in <hi>Office</hi> in the State. And let it be remembred, that this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not applicable, but only where the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> (or <hi>Peoples, Nations, Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. typified by the <hi>Sea</hi>) are ſet in oppoſition one againſt the other.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Let the Reader now judge from what has been ſaid, whether or no the <hi>Pope</hi> be <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> If he be not, I confeſs I am miſtaken. Which is no more than what is very incident to me, and may befall even the beſt of thoſe that differ from me. I will therefore make this bargain with the Reader, if he pleaſes; That, ſince the Error may be <hi>his,</hi> as well as <hi>mine,</hi> we will reſolve to put a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſtruction upon one anothers Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, not imputing them to <hi>Malice,</hi> but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:38410:219"/>to humane <hi>Frailty.</hi> However, whether I have err'd, or not, in the Premiſes; it is certain, that the Concluſion I have gone about to prove, is no other thing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than what (as hath been ſaid at firſt) was the acknowledged Tradition of the Primitive Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Antichriſt ſhould riſe upon the ruines of the Roman Empire.</hi> And if there be any Truth in my Probations, we are to underſtand that Propoſition thus: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was next to ſucceed thoſe <hi>two Wings of the Great Eagle,</hi> which were <hi>given to the Woman</hi> to carry her into the Wilderneſs. So that upon the failing of either of thoſe Wings, (for then the other was not able to ſupport her) we muſt conceive the <hi>Woman</hi> to have come into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that is, to that degenerate Antichriſtian State, which is ſet forth to us <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii. 3, 4, 5. But certainly, if any thing that I have ſaid be true, 'tis this: That by the <hi>Woman</hi> there, is meant the <hi>Church</hi> (and not the <hi>Heathen City</hi>) of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if I were to lay my life upon it, (which I hope that neither I, nor any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:38410:220"/>ſhall have need to do) I dare almoſt be confident I ſhould win. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever if even here I am miſtaken alſo; I ſhall be very glad of any better Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from them. And let it be decided, if they pleaſe, by proper, gentle, and convincing Arguments. For I hope, they will not go about to prove by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Fagot, Sword</hi> and <hi>Slaughter,</hi> that they are not <hi>drunken with the Blood of Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus.</hi>
